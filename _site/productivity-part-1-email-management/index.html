  <p>Folks, we need to have a serious talk about your productivity. I’m not blaming you; I know you didn’t mean to cause any harm. Somewhere along the way, though, one mishap led to another and before you knew it, you sank and staggered along under a crushing weight.</p>

<p><em>This is Part 1 in a 3 part series on productivity. <a href="/productivity-part-2-todo-management" title="Productivity: Task Management">Part 2 covers todo management</a> and <a href="/productivity-part-3-material-archiving" title="Productivity: Material Archiving">Part 3 covers material archiving</a>.</em></p>

<p>The boulder called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">email</span> is a burdensome one, indeed.</p>

<p>Have no fear, intrepid do-gooder. The first step is to admit that you need help. Though I am by no means an expert, hopefully my experiences can help you. Allow me to tell you a story about how I first boosted my productivity by getting my email under control.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Email management is so crucial to a productive lifestyle; here, I show you how I do it.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-started">How It Started</h2>

<p>The year was 2006. I was a Sophomore in college and, for the first time in my life, learning that I had <em>zero</em> grasp on technology. High school hadn’t readied me for the deep technological topics, mountains of technical assignments, or barrage of new communication methods that I’d faced in my first 1+ years.</p>

<p>One day, a friend introduced me to <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/" title="Lifehacker">Lifehacker</a>. I quickly became hooked. I came across an article by Lifehacker’s editor, Gina Trapani, called <a href="http://lifehacker.com/182318/empty-your-Inbox-with-the-trusted-trio" title="Empty Your Inbox with the Trusted Trio">Empty Your Inbox with the Trusted Trio</a>. The title piqued my curiosity. I was, indeed, struggling heavily at that time with how much email college brought along with it. Though I was slow to admit it, I needed a strategy and Gina’s article gave me my start.</p>

<h2 id="the-trusted-trio">The Trusted Trio</h2>

<p>Gina’s own struggles centered on too many email folders:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not long ago, I kept a lengthening list of folders in my email software to track messages by topic, sender, project, urgency and any other context that seemed relevant that hour. I’d spend lots of time carefully dragging and dropping every message from my Inbox into the folder it seemed to belong in that day. After awhile I had so many folders the system was completely useless. Some of the folders – even after the work of creating and populating them – I barely ever opened again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I resonated with this immediately. At the time, I had one email account: my collegiate account. The account had over 20 folders (some related to the university at large, some to specific classes, some to organizations I’d joined, and still others for random organization).</p>

<p>I recognized two very bad habits I’d developed from this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When I read an email, I would spend upwards of <em>2 – 3 minutes</em> trying to figure out (a) whether I should keep the email and, if so, (b) which folder it should go into (even more horrifying were the emails that could apply to more than one folder).</li>
  <li>In the event that I couldn’t figure out what to do with an email, I’d just say, “Screw it” and leave it in my Inbox (which, I later learned, is not all that dissimilar from opening one’s physical mailbox, reading some mail, stuffing it back in the mailbox, and running away).</li>
</ol>

<p>I needed something better. My productivity was suffering and I knew it.</p>

<p>I focused on Gina’s principles and got to work. With a few days of trial and tinkering, I landed on a system that I still use to this day.</p>

<h2 id="my-setup-for-email-productivity">My Setup for Email Productivity</h2>

<p>My email setup – no matter personal or professional, or which email client I use – utilizes 4 different “buckets.” Let me first describe what the buckets are; then, I’ll describe how the system works.</p>

<h3 id="inbox">Inbox</h3>

<p>The Inbox is self-explanatory: any arriving email goes here. However, it exists only as a temporary holding pen; the system forces me to do something with every email I read. Nothing stays here for very long.</p>

<h3 id="follow-up">Follow Up</h3>

<p>When I receive actionable emails (i.e., those that need a follow up on and will need more effort than I can spend), they go into this folder. I also create a corresponding to-do item in my to-do list (a topic for Part 2 in this series).</p>

<h3 id="waiting-for">Waiting For</h3>

<p>When I have an email that I’ve delegated to someone else, I put it into this folder. Even though I’ve delegated the email, I want to keep track of it to make sure it gets done. Thus, I keep my eye on this folder every day or so.</p>

<h3 id="archive">Archive</h3>

<p>All emails that are processed, responded to, and deemed “not trash-worthy” go into the Archive. One folder, ladies and gentlemen. I don’t keep folders for every project, every category, and every combination of random thought. I trust that my email client will allow me to search through that Archive if I need anything.</p>

<p>Gina puts it best: <em>“Basically, whenever an email is ‘closed’ but you may find it useful at some point in the future place it in Archive.”</em></p>

<hr />

<p>That’s it. 4 buckets are all I need. With these in place, I am able to efficiently handle my email with ease. My productivity soars and I am happier, calmer, and more at ease.</p>

<h2 id="put-into-practice">Put Into Practice</h2>

<p>Enough theory; let’s look at how this works in practice. Note that I’ve replaced the names of the real senders.</p>

<p>Let’s pop open my email client:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/01/Untitled-14.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-264" src="/assets/2014/01/Untitled-14.jpg" alt="Emails to Process" width="511" height="385" /></a></p>

<p>6 new emails! Looks like I have some work to do.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I start at the top. My Sales VP is thanking me for participating in our annual Sales Summit. I respond with a quick thank-you. I want to keep this email, so I put it in the Archive. <strong>1 down.</strong></li>
  <li>
    <p>The next email is from a coworker and has pictures of me DJing for the first time. I save the picture into iPhoto and delete the email. <strong>2 down.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third email is from a project manager, thanking me for my help earlier in the day. I respond with a quick thank-you and delete it. <strong>3 down.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth email is from our chief of staff, asking for thoughts on space planning in our building. I need to craft a response, but I don’t have time to do it now. I move it to Follow Up. <strong>4 down.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fifth email is from a potential technology partner. I send it to a colleague who handles that kind of thing. Since I’m the original recipient, I want to keep my eye on the chain, so I put it in Waiting For. <strong>5 down.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>The sixth email is from a client explaining that they will be a few days late on a deadline. I put it in Waiting For. <strong>6 down.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>And just like that, my Inbox is clear and my emails are organized:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/01/Untitled-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-265" src="/assets/2014/01/Untitled-2.jpg" alt="Empty Inbox" width="511" height="385" /></a></p>

<h2 id="some-closing-thoughts">Some Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>You might read this with a full Inbox and think, “There’s no way I can do that.” Or, you might be thinking, “This sounds like too much work.” Even worse, you might say to yourself, “Productivity is relative; my system works fine.”</p>

<p>I can’t speak to your personal situation, but I bet that for most of you, you’re right on one count: this does take work and dedication. But you can do it. If your Inbox is currently overloaded, break it into batches of 10-15 emails and walk through Steps #1 – #6 above. When you complete with that batch, move to the next one. Before you know it, your Inbox will be clear and your mind will be at ease.</p>

<p>This is worth your time. I cannot communicate the amazing clarity and peace-of-mind that comes from having an empty Inbox and an organized email system at the end of each day. A good productivity system should free your mind from minutia so that you can focus on what you really want/need to get done.</p>

<p>Take some time and get your email situation cleared up. You won’t be sorry.</p>
