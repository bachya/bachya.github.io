<article class="post-content">
  <p>The other day, my wife and I were settling in to dig through our Hulu Plus queue. What started out as a grand TV binge-a-thon, however, quickly turned into frustration: each show would play for about 5 seconds, buffer anywhere from 20-30 seconds, then repeat.</p>

<p>I ran the usual gamut of test/support steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Checked my internet speed via <a href="http://speedtest.net" target="_blank">speedtest.net</a> (using the same wired connection that my Samsung Smart TV uses). 56 Mbps down, 30 Mbps up, 16 ms ping. <em>Far</em> beyond what would be necessary for this type of venture.</li>
  <li>Called Hulu Support; received a healthy amount of, “Hmm, we’re not sure, but we’ll credit your account one month.” Nice, but not what I needed.</li>
  <li>Tested the cabling from the TV to the router (a Cisco E1000 v.1 running DD-WRT). Smooth and running fine.</li>
</ol>

<p>Despite all of these (rather obvious) measures, more and more stuttering. Frustrating, frustrating, frustrating. I hunted around the internet, but couldn’t find anything having to do with solid, reliable stutter-removal advice for Hulu.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Using DD-WRT, it is possible to re-reroute the DNS servers for specific hosts on a network.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>

<p>So, given that Hulu wasn’t reliably the source of the problem, I turned to the idea that something in <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index" target="_blank">DD-WRT</a> – our router’s killer alternate firmware – was involved (or that DD-WRT might contain something that would help).</p>

<p>Blessedly, I eventually landed on this page at the DD-WRT wiki: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=530053" target="_blank">Netflix streaming, pausing every 30 seconds, wired</a>. Of particular note was the comment left by Luniz2k1, one of DD-WRT’s gurus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the use of OpenDNS instead of your local ISP’s DNS has a very big impact on web site performance. Major sites and media companies uses content delivery network. If you used openDNS to lookup sites like <a href="http://www.apple.com%2C/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.apple.com,</a> you will get faraway IP addresses compared to using your ISP’s DNS. As a result, downloads and videos are slower.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting. We do, indeed, use OpenDNS for content filtering (and do so in a rather hardcore fashion at the router level via DD-WRT, per <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/OpenDNS" target="_blank">this guide</a> – of particular note, we use DD-WRT to enforce OpenDNS’s servers for every client on our network).</p>

<p>Completely out of other options, I temporarily allowed our Samsung TV to point back to our ISP’s DNS servers…</p>

<p>‘Lo and behold: no more stuttering. “Water in the desert” doesn’t even come close to describing my joy.</p>

<p>After a few moments, however, I crashed back to reality with a painful thought: I wanted to allow my Samsung TV to access our ISP’s DNS servers, but still force other clients – laptops, phones, etc. – to use OpenDNS. What’s worse, there didn’t appear to be any documentation out on the internet that described such a process.</p>

<p>After much toil (which I’ll leave out here), I landed on modifying my iptables (the firewall that DD-WRT uses) rules to allow for certain hosts to use certain DNS servers.</p>

<p>Here’s the full firewall configuration for this specific maneuver:</p>

<noscript><pre>400: Invalid request
</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/0f7d8dca2b3b6f2174a8.js"> </script>

<p>Allow me to describe in detail what’s occurring here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first three blocks relate to the three devices that should bypass OpenDNS: our Samsung TV, a Media Center PC, and out PS3. Note that I’m referring to hostnames and not IP addresses; because many devices – like the PS3 and Samsung TV – don’t report a hostname, you can use <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Static_DHCP" target="_blank">Static Leases</a> to enforcehostnames.
    <ul>
      <li>The work is done on the PREROUTING chain (before the request is fired off).</li>
      <li>The redirection happens using both TCP and UDP.</li>
      <li>`nvram get wan_get_dns` returns back a space-delimited string of our WAN’s DNS IPs. A subsequent call to `awk` splits out the first IP.</li>
      <li><strong>ALL TOLD:</strong> these rules force traffic from three specific hosts to use the first WAN DNS IP (as reported by DD-WRT).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The last two rules follow a similar approach: they merely force all clients (really, all <em>other</em> clients – because iptables is a first-match-wins firewall, any non-TV/Media Center/PS3 will hit this rule) to use the router’s DNS IPs (which are set to OpenDNS).</li>
</ol>

<p>Even though I had hoped for an easier, more supported method, I’m happy with this solution. DD-WRT Land appears “okay” with it, too: as of today, <a href="http://dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=256340" target="_blank">my forum post at the DD-WRT wiki has no responses</a>, despite over 200 views. If you can think of a better way, though, I’m all ears.</p>
