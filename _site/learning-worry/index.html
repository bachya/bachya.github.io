<article class="post-content">
  <p>I may not look it to the people who know me, but I am a grade A worrier. Despite my daily work, I have the capacity to worry about nearly <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>I realize that when people say they are worriers, they often stop short of explaining why. My ongoing goal is to be honest with you, so here are the things I worry about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I worry that if I don’t check in with people I love on a regular basis, they will start to lose their love for me.</li>
  <li>I worry that when I decline invitations to go do something (because I’m tired, because I’m burnt out, etc.), I lose a chunk of the relationship I had with the person I declined.</li>
  <li>I worry that when I don’t have the strength to give 100% on any particular day, others will lose their respect for me.</li>
  <li>I worry that I am selfish in my expectations for what my relationships should look like.</li>
  <li>Whenever I have a difficult moment in a relationship (and act in a way unbecoming of me), I worry that will be the last conversation I have with that person.</li>
  <li>I worry that in trying to practice my greatest wish – to be Christ to the world – my shortcomings, mistakes, and poor choices make it so I leave no lasting impact on the lives I care about.</li>
</ul>

<p>On and on it goes. Very few days go by where I don’t think about at least one of these (or the myriad others not mentioned here). Some days, it’s easy to give up the worrying to God; I am able to say, “Please take this from me” and He does – it bleeds away. Other days are harder; despite continued requests, the worrying sits on my chest like a boulder.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>God helped me realize today that there are some basic steps to deal with my worries.</p>

<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>

<p>The heavy days are, as you would imagine, the hardest ones. They have the capacity to sink my mood, put my head in a fog, and leave me thinking, <em>“Why do I bother?”</em><sup id="fnref-1737-1"><a href="#fn-1737-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> When I think about those days, I don’t know which I fear most: that I’m able to bury and hide it, or that others can plainly see that I’m struggling.</p>

<p>Today was one of those days. Horribly, I couldn’t even pinpoint <em>why</em> I was letting worry weigh me down; but it surely did. It hurt. It darkened an otherwise fine day.</p>

<p>So I began to pray.</p>

<h2 id="halt">Halt</h2>

<p>Interestingly, I didn’t pray for relief; I should have – I wanted to – but those words didn’t come out of my mouth. Something else came out: <em>“Why?” </em>I wanted to know why I was struggling (especially given that nothing had brought it on). I craved understanding more than anything.</p>

<p>I came to realize a single word had repeated in my head without me knowing it (the same way a song can just appear in my mind and stay there for hours). Again and again, I heard my voice: <em>halt</em>. I didn’t get it; <em>what is that supposed to mean?</em> I thought. But there wasn’t anything else; just that one word, over and over: <em>halt</em>.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I remembered an old “definition” that I had heard long ago:</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>(ungry) <strong>A</strong>(ngry) <strong>L</strong>(onely) <strong>T</strong>(ired)</p>

<p>“HALT” was the thing to remember when hard feelings came on; it was the circumstances to be aware of when temptation came along; in all things, “HALT” represented four practical emotions and “states of being” to be aware of.</p>

<p>As it kept repeating, I suddenly remembered that I hadn’t eaten much today.<sup id="fnref-1737-2"><a href="#fn-1737-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Once I took the time to eat a meal, the sad feelings slowly faded away. It wasn’t long until they disappeared completely.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p>I realize that this sounds blindingly obvious. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, I became really good at diagnosing difficult spiritual issues and lost my ability to see the basics. Therein lies my struggle: sometimes, those basics are so foreign to me that their absence overtakes my life.</p>

<p>In taking some time to think about it, I realize that God taught me an important lesson today: although there certainly are times where something more monstrous is attacking my life<sup id="fnref-1737-3"><a href="#fn-1737-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, there are also times where remembering the basics is all I need.<sup id="fnref-1737-4"><a href="#fn-1737-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Here’s what it means to me.</p>

<h3 id="remember-to-eat-right-and-get-enough-sleep">Remember to eat right and get enough sleep.</h3>

<p>My “I’m hungry” and “I’m tired” mechanisms don’t seem to work like they should. In most cases, hunger equates to grumbling stomachs and tiredness equates to a “I should go to sleep” realization. Not for me. For me, they lead to feelings of fear, sadness, worry, and a general sense of doom-and-gloom. I somehow translate physical feelings into emotional worries without blinking an eye.</p>

<p>So, my response needs to become more automatic: if I begin to worry about anything, I shelve it until I have a chance to eat and get some sleep. If, after all that, I still feel the heaviness, then I will allow myself to re-examine it.</p>

<h3 id="don8217t-let-one-thing-bleed-into-another">Don’t let one thing bleed into another.</h3>

<p>I do this all the time. If work is difficult, I start to wonder if I’m not a great husband, either. <a title="Flying high: Seahawks dominate Broncos in SB XLVIII rout" href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=340202007" target="_blank">If my team loses the Superbowl</a>, I’m prone to feeling depressed about other things.<sup id="fnref-1737-5"><a href="#fn-1737-5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> In so many subtle ways, I allow frustrations in one area become frustrations in another.</p>

<p>That outcome, too, has to be a conscious decision. When I pray about my original frustration, I want it to come with an addendum: “Please help me to not spread this elsewhere.”</p>

<h3 id="let-each-day-be-enough">Let each day be enough.</h3>

<p>I pride myself on being a very good “here-and-now thinker.” I don’t often obsess over the past or fixate on what <em>might</em> happen in the future; I like the here-and-now. But like anyone, I’m not perfect, and the days where I allow myself to get embroiled somewhere else in time become incredibly hard.</p>

<p>Jesus was clear about this: “<em>Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.”</em> (Matthew 6:34 ESV)</p>

<p>There are plenty of times where I know this to be true, but cannot feel it. Those moments, then, are ripe for prayer to remember the moment.</p>

<h3 id="give-others-the-benefit-of-the-doubt">Give others the benefit of the doubt.</h3>

<p>I can’t count the several times I’ve allowed my brain to get carried away into a non-existent reality. All too often, I meet a very strange phenomenon: my brain, digging through various thoughts, will start to play an argument between me and someone I love. It seems harmless enough in the beginning, so I let it go and let my mind wander. Before I know it, I, myself, am engaged in that argument. And in the end, something heavy weighs me down (as if the argument had actually happened).</p>

<p>Sometimes, my day starts out with one of these “head-arguments.” When I see that person in life, my heart hurts; for all it knows, we argued and are at odds with one another.</p>

<p>I’ve also gone the other direction: as I mentioned before, I often imagine that others’ love for me wanes when I decline their invitations, don’t stay in perfectly regular contact, etc. I go ahead and assume (read: make real) that they will be disappointed in me. Before I know it, I’ve convinced myself that it’s all real, and that I <em>should </em>feel sad about it.</p>

<p>The truly scary part: it isn’t real. Only the pain I cause my heart is real. In doing this, I lay a heavy burden on myself and put injustice on the person who unwittingly participated in the head-argument.</p>

<p>So, there, too, is a conscious decision: take every thought captive.<sup id="fnref-1737-6"><a href="#fn-1737-6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> When those things pop into my head, I have to declare the truth: that both parties in that head-argument deserve the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>My intellectual self reads this and goes, “Wow, you think about this stuff <em>way too much</em>.” It’s probably true. That said, these “simple things” have, more times than not, led me down a sad, beleaguered path that I’m tired of walking down. I’ve been bamboozled into thinking that they are too immense for me to address, and it’s time for that to stop.</p>

<p>My new mission has to be that every day, I apply dedication, focus, and obedience to what God says is true: in addition to the heavier things of this world, there are some basics that, followed correctly, will spare a lot of pain.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for showing me this, Father. I walk forward, a little lighter. Tomorrow will be my first steps back toward the basics. Thank you for lovingly guiding me back there.</em></p>

  It&#8217;s interesting that this summer, my small group is studying through the book of Ecclesiastes, which deals with mankind&#8217;s search for what actually has meaning.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1737-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
