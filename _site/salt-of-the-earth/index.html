<article class="post-content">
  <p>Early on in his public ministry, Jesus gave what is perhaps his most famous sermon: The Sermon on the Mount. In it, Jesus provided, among other things, a recipe for what the conduct of his followers should look like.</p>

<p>One of these teachings is never far from my mind:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people’s feet.”</p>

  <p>~ Matthew 5:13 ESV</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a long time, I took this verse rather simplistically: “As a follower of Christ, I must to make the world more flavorful, appetizing, etc.” That felt rather banal to me, but I had no other flash of inspiration; I left it as-is.</p>

<p>The truth is, though I might have pretended otherwise, I didn’t really know what it meant to be “salt” to the world.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Jesus’ command to be the “salt of the earth” is becoming clearer to me as more time goes on.</p>

<h2 id="diving-in">Diving In</h2>

<p>Some time later, I looked into the Greek translation of this verse. Several words popped out to me:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“lost its taste”</em> is the translation for Greek word <em>mórainó</em> <sup id="fnref-490-1"><a href="#fn-490-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Although this word can technically translate as tasteless, it more generally means “to lose usefulness.” <sup id="fnref-490-2"><a href="#fn-490-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><em>“no longer good for anything”</em> is the translation for the Greek word <em>ischuó</em> <sup id="fnref-490-3"><a href="#fn-490-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. This translates as “being unable to [have] embodied strength that “gets into the fray” (action)”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Around the same time, I was reminded of a blindingly obvious principle that we don’t often think about in today’s world. In the ancient world, flavoring wasn’t salt’s only (or, arguably, <em>primary</em>) purpose; it’s also acted a preservative. Quite simply, salt was used to make sure things didn’t spoil further. This was a potent concept in antiquity <sup id="fnref-490-4"><a href="#fn-490-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Salt’s preservative ability was a foundation of civilization. It eliminated dependency on the seasonal availability of food and allowed travel over long distances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something began to stir in my mind. I had blown off a passage that seemed to have a deeper meaning for my life.</p>

<p>The pieces began to assemble themselves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus calls his followers to be the “salt of the earth.” In the spirit of preservation, one meaning of this must have been, “Your presence and actions – your ability to ‘get into the fray’ – should save your corner of the world from spoiling.”</li>
  <li>If one of his followers should “lose his taste” (i.e., become unable to do his preservative duty), his worth would be all but eliminated.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I finally began to understand this verse’s nature – especially in my world – I began to see life in a more serious way. I started to see the rot. Hurts, broken relationships, downtrodden journeys, anger, malice, bitterness, jealousy…none of it is very unique, unfortunately, but it was all there, around me and <em>in</em> me.</p>

<p>The world’s hurts were far bigger than myself, but I began to feel responsibility (not only for adding to those hurts, but especially for neglecting my role as a salve). I feared that laziness would result in being “thrown out and trampled under people’s feet.”</p>

<p>All of this crystalized into one central thought: I needed to change the way I faced each day.</p>

<h2 id="the-way-forward">The Way Forward</h2>

<p>A follower of Jesus should make the world around him better. He should inject both goodness and kindness into it. He should help shoulder the burdens of others and share what he has in his own life. He should show up in life’s most difficult moments and jump into the fray. To him, that should be the salt.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, my day will begin like any other. I’ll spend important time with my wife. I’ll interact with employees, coworkers, clients, and friends through a bevy of experiences. I’ll chat with family. In these experiences, I want to be salt. I want to celebrate the victories and accomplishments of others. I want to speak truth to those whose lives need it. I want to cry with and hug those who are hurting and shaken. In all things, I want my corner of the world to <em>hurt less</em> because of Jesus’ command to me: be the salt.</p>

<p>I won’t be perfect; God knows that my own struggles, deficiencies, judgements, and biases will deflect me from my purpose. I will clang around, trying to find my way amidst a cacophony of troubles. I will undoubtedly fail and ask forgiveness for those failings.</p>

<p>In all things, however, my commitment to my corner of the world remains the same: every single day I am alive, I will get into the fray with you. I will strive to be the salt.</p>
