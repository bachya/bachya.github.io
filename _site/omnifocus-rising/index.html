<article class="post-content">
  <p>At some point, I began to fall out of love with my longtime friend, <a href="http://www.toodledo.com">Toodledo</a>. I didn’t want it to happen – he’d served me faithfully for years – but time and tide revealed my need for more.</p>

<p>The disillusionment came when <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/forums/profile.php?user=185529" title="Proximo">Damian Castillo, aka Proximo</a> (a prolific Toodledo user whose <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/forums/5/2660/0/proximos-gtd-setup.html" title="Proximo's GTD Setup">outstanding GTD setup</a> was the basis for my own) <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/forums/5/5313/0/good-bye-from-proximo.html" title="Good Bye from Proximo">revealed that he was leaving Toodledo behind</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My decision was based on personal preference and a solid focus to GTD. GTD is very simple and when implemented correctly, it allows you to get things done and be more productive. I was tired of making Toodledo work for GTD and spent way too much time fixing, tweaking, hacking it to do GTD.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I though back to <a href="http://www.bachyaproductions.com/productivity-part-2-todo-management/" title="Productivity, Part 2: Todo Management">my guide to todo management</a>; I loved that little held-together-by-spit-and-glue system, but a part of me was starting to agree with Proximo. I, too, was spending too much time mending it, fixing it, improving it, etc.<sup id="fnref-1544-1"><a href="#fn-1544-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>That wasn’t the only issue. I was growing dissatisfied with the UI of Toodledo (both the web app and the iOS app). Common actions – like adding subtasks – were unnecessarily difficult. Synchronization of my Saved Searches was sporadic. Each tiny issue added to my growing frustration.</p>

<p>And so, I began to look around.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>I’m leaving Toodledo for OmniFocus; here are the reasons why.</p>

<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>

<p>I started my journey by following Proximo from Toodledo to <a href="http://www.nirvanahq.com" title="Nirvana">Nirvana</a>. That worked for a little bit – <a href="http://www.bachyaproductions.com/link-mash-march-20-2014/" title="Link Mash (March 20, 2014)">I was even excited about it</a> – but I didn’t care for its stagnant development cycle (well into 2014, it still had an old-school iOS 5-esque UI) or <a href="http://forums.nirvanahq.com/discussion/983/is-nirvanahq-development-frozen/p1" title="Is NirvanaHQ development frozen?">the deafening silence from its developers</a>. My excitement faded within a week and I moved on.</p>

<p>The next app I tried was <a href="http://doit.im/">Doit.im</a>. It, too, was a great GTD-focused app and worked well for a time. But I didn’t love it. Something about the experience wasn’t great. Like Nirvana, it seemed like a long time had passed since its last update. My experience with Doit.im lasted longer than my experience with Nirvana, but in the end, it didn’t do it for me.<sup id="fnref-1544-2"><a href="#fn-1544-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Day after day, I kept Googling for “GTD apps.” I spent time each night looking through the App Store’s Productivity category. I didn’t find the magic bullet I was looking for.</p>

<p>During these searches, I did notice a name pop up time and time again: <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus" title="OmniFocus">OmniFocus</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-courtship">The Courtship</h2>

<p>I remember hearing about OmniFocus (and the <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/" title="The Omni Group">Omni Group</a>‘s other products, such as <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/" title="OmniGraffle">OmniGraffle</a>) all the way back in college.<sup id="fnref-1544-3"><a href="#fn-1544-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> As I started to browse a bit, I was struck by one thought: “This is a <em>beautiful</em> app.”</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-11-at-5.20.40-PM.png" alt="OmniFocus for OS X" /></p>

<p>In both the iOS and OS X versions of the app, it was clear that the Omni Group had taken great care in designing an experience that was beautiful, pleasing to look at, and a great UI experience.</p>

<p>I deliberated. Did I want to try <em>yet another</em> GTD system (and one that, compared to several others I’d tried, was expensive)? Did I want to effectively lock myself into the Apple ecosystem with my todo management?<sup id="fnref-1544-4"><a href="#fn-1544-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Rather rashly, I bought the iOS version and began using it. And in two weeks, I fell in love. It was simple; it was elegant; most of all, it fit GTD concepts without needing much tweaking at all. For the first time in ages, I was able to focus more on my tasks than on the system managing them.</p>

<p>The one piece missing was the desktop component. I wasn’t my most effective without a desktop companion to OmniFocus. That said, I kept halting myself. The version of OmniFocus that I wanted – the Professional version that had all the mouthwatering features – was $79.99. Yikes.</p>

<p>I deliberated some more. Finally, I bit the bullet, bought it, and didn’t look back.</p>

<p>In the time since, OmniFocus has become my go-to companion. It isn’t perfect, but more often than not, it <em>just works</em>. It’s a joy to use. It helps me focus. Most importantly, it doesn’t get in the way.</p>

<p>Allow me to share my specifics with you. This won’t be an authoritative post on OmniFocus itself; rather, it will be the story of how I’ve made it work for me.</p>

<h2 id="initial-considerations">Initial Considerations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Much of my OmniFocus setup is reliant on the <a href="https://manage.sync.omnigroup.com/" title="Omni Sync Server">Omni Sync Server</a>, which, among other things, allows tasks to synchronize nicely between the iOS and OS X versions of the app.</li>
  <li>I ended up purchasing the Professional Version because of Focus Mode, Custom Perspectives, and Applescript Support. Be aware that the Standard Version does not include these features.</li>
  <li>A healthy understanding of GTD is necessary to understand this material and is not something I provide here. Googling for “GTD” should get you going.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>Projects in OmniFocus are exactly what they sound like: grouped sets of tasks geared at accomplishing a discreet purpose. Additionally, OmniFocus carries the nice ability to group projects into folders, which allows for more fine-grained tuning.</p>

<p>Here’s my setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Work Folder</strong></li>
  <li><strong>_Next Actions:</strong> a Single Action project that holds my independent work tasks that don’t have due dates.</li>
  <li><strong>_Scheduled:</strong> a Single Action project that holds my independent work tasks that have due dates.</li>
  <li><strong>Projects Folder:</strong> contains all of my work projects (and their associated tasks).</li>
  <li><strong>Personal Folder</strong></li>
  <li><strong>_Next Actions:</strong> a Single Action project that holds my independent personal tasks that don’t have due dates.</li>
  <li><strong>_Scheduled:</strong> a Single Action project that holds my independent personal tasks that have due dates.</li>
  <li><strong>Projects Folder:</strong> contains all of my personal projects (and their associated tasks).</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, I employ two other Single Action projects that conform to GTD principles: <strong>Someday/Maybe</strong> and <strong>Ticklers</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-11-at-6.22.58-PM.png" alt="My OmniFocus Project List" /></p>

<p>Notice that I have <strong>_Next Actions</strong> and <strong>_Scheduled</strong> projects for both my work and personal life. I do this for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It allows me to separate those tasks that have hard due dates and those that don’t.</li>
  <li>It allows me to split work from personal life – using OmniFocus’ Focus Mode, I can choose what folders I want to focus on.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="flags">Flags</h2>

<p>Flags are much like Toodledo’s stars; as such, I use them in a similar manner: when I flag a task, I’m saying that I want to tackle it today. Tasks that I flag don’t generally have due dates; rather, they are pulled from the “work on them whenever you want to” pool for today.</p>

<h2 id="perspectives">Perspectives</h2>

<p>Perspectives in OmniFocus are custom views that allow you to view tasks that fit specific criteria. By default, OmniFocus comes with a set of base Perspectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inbox:</strong> New tasks are created here by default.</li>
  <li><strong>Contexts:</strong> Displays all contexts stored within OmniFocus, as well as the tasks that use those Contexts.</li>
  <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Displays all projects stored within OmniFocus.</li>
  <li><strong>Changed:</strong> Displays all recently changed items (tasks, projects, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Flagged:</strong> Displays all tasks that have their flag set.</li>
  <li><strong>Completed:</strong> Displays all recently completed tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Review:</strong> Displays OmniFocus’ project review, in which users perform their daily review.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these, I’ve created several of my own custom perspectives, which are detailed here. Note that the custom icons I use were pulled from the <a href="https://github.com/deaghean/omnifocus-perspective-icons" title="OmniFocus Perspective Icons">OmniFocus Perspective Icons repository on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="stalled">Stalled</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-11-at-5.59.47-PM.png" alt="OmniFocus Stalled Perspective" /></p>

<p>This perspective shows any projects that don’t have any actions assigned to them. This allows me to do a quick mental check – is there more to that project, or should I close it out?</p>

<h3 id="waiting">Waiting</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-11-at-6.04.58-PM.png" alt="OmniFocus Waiting Perspective" /></p>

<p>This perspective makes use of a context called “Waiting For” – this allows me to quickly see all tasks that I’m waiting on a response for.</p>

<h3 id="delegated">Delegated</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-11-at-6.06.50-PM.png" alt="OmniFocus Delegated Perspective" /></p>

<p>Similar to my Waiting perspective, this one gives me a quick view into the tasks that I’ve delegated to others.</p>

<h3 id="candidates">Candidates</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-11-at-6.09.52-PM.png" alt="OmniFocus Candidates Perspective" /></p>

<p>This perspective shows my available tasks that don’t have due dates. These are the tasks that are sitting around, ready for me to address them at my leisure. Notice that I have elements under the Focus drop down; in particular, I’ve excluded any <strong>_Scheduled</strong> tasks because I only want to see those that are available at my leisure.</p>

<h3 id="hotlist">Hotlist</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-11-at-6.25.51-PM.png" alt="OmniFocus Hotlist Perspective" /></p>

<p>This is my primary perspective; it allows me to see any tasks due/overdue and any flagged tasks (thus allowing me to get a handle on what I need to be working on today).</p>

<h2 id="my-flow">My Flow</h2>

<p>With these custom perspectives in place, here is the flow I follow on a regular basis:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Inbox.</strong> If there are new tasks in my Inbox, I assign a context to them and assign them to a project. This gets them out of the Inbox and into the rest of the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Stalled.</strong> Next, I check this perspective to see if there are any projects that have stalled (i.e., have no actions left). I quickly deal with them, either by adding tasks or closing the project.</li>
  <li><strong>Waiting.</strong> Waiting reminds me of the owned-by-others tasks that I need to keep an eye on. If I need to follow up on any that day, I flag them.</li>
  <li><strong>Delegated.</strong> Next, I check this perspective to see if I need to act on any tasks that I’ve assigned to others. If I do that day, I flag them.</li>
  <li><strong>Forecast.</strong> I check this perspective to see if any tasks have suddenly become available today (i.e., today is their “Defer Until” date). Of those that do become available, I flag the ones I want to work on today.</li>
  <li><strong>Candidates.</strong> This view contains any available tasks that were available before today, but which I did not choose to act on. Same drill: I flag any tasks that I want to work on today.</li>
  <li><strong>Hotlist.</strong> This is the final stop: all the tasks that I’ve flagged, plus any due/overdue ones appear here. From this list, I get to work.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="applescript-support">Applescript Support</h2>

<p>I mentioned in <a href="http://www.bachyaproductions.com/evernote-meet-nvalt/" title="Evernote, Meet nvALT">a previous post</a> that I have a Hazel action that continually scans my nvALT notes for <code>[ x ]</code> symbols and adds their contents to OmniFocus. Allow me to share.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>OmniFocus has done the job so far. I will continue to revise my flow over time, but for now, I’m enjoying my return to GTD’s central tenant of stress free productivity.</p>
