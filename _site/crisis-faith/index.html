  <blockquote>
  <p>Then Jesus told his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.” (Matthew 16:24-25 ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the most prevalent outside perspectives about the Christian life is that, in practicing it, the follower of Christ never (or rarely) experiences hardship. To many, Christian lives are full of overabundance and sugary, giddy joy. They are devoid of the sadness, pain, and heartbreak suffered by everyone else.</p>

<p>It’s also a viewpoint that couldn’t be further from the truth.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>I’m struggling in my faith right now and I want to be upfront about it.</p>

<h2 id="the-truth">The Truth</h2>

<p>True Christians – that is, those who eschew the hypocrisy and <em>holier-than-thou</em> haughtiness that has come to represent the modern church – suffer immense heartache all the time. This is, I believe, directly connected to God’s entry into our souls; simply put, we hurt because we see all sorts of hurting things around us.</p>

<p>The other day, I began to make a list of the things that give me true heartache on a day-to-day basis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I hurt when I see homeless people begging for money, food, shelter, or whatever other comforts they lack. I hurt even more when my own selfishness tempts me to look the other way and let the homeless be someone else’s problem.</li>
  <li>I hurt when I see the injustices of life fall on perfectly good people, seemingly for no reason. I hurt even more when I began to think, “God, how could you possibly allow such pain on them?”</li>
  <li>I hurt when I experience my own selfishness rise up against others; the moments in which a snappy tone, clipped sentence, or fierce look shame or emotionally bludgeon others are awful.</li>
  <li>I hurt when I look at blogs, news websites, or magazines and see the things that society has come to value. I hurt even more when I realize that all too often, I’ve valued those same things.</li>
  <li>I hurt when I look at those same websites and experience the vitriolic “comments section”; with the anonymity given by the internet, people freely criticize not only each other’s opinions, but each other’s worth, as well. I hurt even more when I recognize that I, too, have the same tendency to sit back and snipe at anyone whose opinion I disagree with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these (and so many more) constantly sit on the heart of a Christian. His life is so fundamentally changed that he cannot force those thoughts and feelings elsewhere. Through it all, however, the Christian relies on faith in God.</p>

<h2 id="the-deception">The Deception</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.” (Matthew 7:24-27 ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a moment, however, where something hurts in a scarier, more fundamental way: the moment in a Christian’s life where faith fails him. Despite his best efforts, his most sincere dedication to God, and his fundamental wish to pursue Him, thoughts begin to creep into his mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>I haven’t felt God in a really long time.</em></li>
  <li><em>I scrape through life, trying to pursue God, and for what?</em></li>
  <li><em>Now that I think of it, I’ve prayed for XYZ for a long time and He hasn’t answered me. He must not care (or He must not exist).</em></li>
  <li><em>“God, I’m so angry at you; what have I done to deserve this?”</em></li>
  <li><em>Am I just another in a long line of people, places, situations, etc. that God has abandoned?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>As that spiral continues, the Christian begins to feel a sense of utter despair. Everything he bases his life on shutters; in time, it slowly starts to eat into his very being.</p>

<p>It is this haunting place that I now find myself in.</p>

<p>I don’t know how I got here. For months, I had recognized that my “feeling” of God was noticeably absent; though I believed in Him and based my life upon Him, I still felt a sense of emptiness. Knowing that my feelings are prone to deception<sup id="fnref-666-1"><a href="#fn-666-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, I put little stock in this; I put one foot in front of the other, day after day, and trusted.</p>

<p>As time went on, however, it became something more. It became heavier and more real. It was never far from my mind. Without realizing it, I had entered what St. John of the Cross called the “Dark Night of the Soul”<sup id="fnref-666-2"><a href="#fn-666-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>: a dark, empty place where any sense of God fled from me.</p>

<p>It’s an awful place.</p>

<p>Not long ago, I read that Mother Teresa had a similar crisis of faith for much of her life.<sup id="fnref-666-3"><a href="#fn-666-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Her powerfully sad words echo the exact state I feel right now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Lord, my God, you have thrown [me] away as unwanted – unloved,” she wrote in one missive. “I call, I cling, I want, and there is no one to answer, no, no one. Alone. Where is my faith? even deep down right in there is nothing. I have no faith. I dare not utter the words and thoughts that crowd in my heart.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bingo. Right now, my heart is tugging left and right. In one instant, I am convinced that God, if He exists, has no interest in me; in the next instant, I berate myself for having such little faith in the God that I have professed to love so dearly.</p>

<p>My constant thought: <em>God, I have shown you faith; why do I not see you?</em></p>

<h2 id="the-way-forward">The Way Forward</h2>

<p>Each time I burn over God’s missing presence in my life, I see the same verse, over and over, in my mind:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.” (John 20:29 ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think, <em>I have believed, Lord. But not being able to see is wearing me down.</em></p>

<p>This is a scary place; I’ve never really been here before. I’m sure that those who don’t believe in God would tell me that what I’m feeling is natural; I <em>should</em> feel emptiness of belief because there isn’t anything to believe in. I’m equally certain that at the other end, the especially devout would tell me to continue on, regardless. Both viewpoints fail to take into account the strange precipice I stand on.</p>

<p>And so, here I am. Hurting. Uncertain. And yet, despite all this, I’m choosing to hold my faith close.</p>

<p>What I can believe, deep in my heart, is that this is a time where the rain is falling. My foundation is being tested. When all is said and done, my faith will be fundamentally different. I will be fundamentally different.</p>

<p>Life is full of Christian stories that are of the <em>happily-ever-after</em> variety. Mine is not. Mine is gritty. It is inconvenient. It is unconventional. It is real. I committed to you, dear reader, that I would express my life in its reality; consider this a partial fulfillment of that promise.</p>

<p>And what of God? What of the Great Unknown? I will continue to seek Him. I will continue to study His word. I will continue to rise each day and pray for the strength to treat others as He would. I will continue to ask Him to show me His love for me.</p>

<p>I won’t do it out of obligation; I will do it because, despite it all, I love Him.</p>
