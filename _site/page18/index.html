        <p class="post-summary">
          
            <p><a title="Leo Mirani" href="http://qz.com/author/lmiraniqz/" target="_blank">Leo Mirani</a> at Quartz <a title="iOS 8 strikes an unexpected blow against location tracking" href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5792970/ios-8-strikes-an-unexpected-blow-against-location-tracking" target="_blank">describes</a> a relatively unnoticed addition to iOS 8 – MAC address spoofing – that will change the consumer privacy landscape:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s solution, as discovered by a Swiss programmer, is for iOS 8, the new operating system for iPhones which will be out later this year, to generate a random MAC addresses while scanning for networks. That means that companies and agencies that collect such information will not necessarily know when the same device (i.e., person) visits a store twice, or that the same device pops up in stores across the country or the world, suggesting a much-travelled owner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is this important? You should probably know by now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whenever you walk around a major Western city with your phone’s Wi-Fi turned on, you are broadcasting your location to government agencies, marketing companies and location analytics firms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This system, <a title="Russell Brandom" href="http://www.theverge.com/users/russell.brandom" target="_blank">Russell Brandom</a> at The Verge <a title="iOS 8 strikes an unexpected blow against location tracking" href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5792970/ios-8-strikes-an-unexpected-blow-against-location-tracking" target="_blank">explains</a>, is more complex than most consumers realize:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/15/business/attention-shopper-stores-are-tracking-your-cell.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">reported last summer</a>, shops from Nordstrom’s to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/23/2582443/two-us-malls-will-track-shoppers-location-via-their-cellphone-this" target="_blank">JC Penney</a> have tried out the system. (London even tried out a system <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/08/no-this-isnt-a-scene-from-minority-report-this-trash-can-is-stalking-you/" target="_blank">using public trash cans</a>.) The system automatically logs any phone within Wi-Fi range, giving stores a complete record of who walked into the shop and when. But any phone using iOS 8 will be invisible to the process, potentially calling the whole system into question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s concrete effort to step out of this arena is pretty shocking, but in a good way. In a post-NSA-awareness world, tech giants who choose to protect privacy (like <a title="Google is encrypting search globally. That’s bad for the NSA and China’s censors." href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/03/12/google-is-encrypting-search-worldwide-thats-bad-for-the-nsa-and-china/" target="_blank">Google</a> and now, Apple) might actually be able to win back some of the trust lost during the last year. The trick, as always, is consistency.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has a lot more going on in iOS 8 besides these changes, but they make it just that much easier for those trying to use mobile devices to encourage sales and commerce activity. It’s still unclear what, if any kind of mobile commerce push Apple will make itself – we’ve heard rumors about iTunes becoming a platform for much broader types of payments for a while now – but in the meantime, it’s clear it still wants to be the best mobile platform for those looking to drive pay-based engagement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m intrigued to see what Apple does here. We’ve already discussed the idea that <a title="→ The Death of Mobile Payments" href="http://readwrite.com/2014/05/13/mobile-wallets-reality" target="_blank">our society isn’t ready for a lifestyle of mobile payments</a>, but what if one of the most valuable companies on the planet (a) removes friction from the experience and (b) convinces its customers that they <em>have</em> to be a part of the experience.</p>

<p>Since last week, something has become increasingly clear: iOS 7 wasn’t the flop that everyone thought it was; it merely laid the groundwork for iOS 8. This could be a similar scenario: might we look back at iOS 8 and see the foundation for a revolution in mobile commerce?</p>

        <p class="post-summary">
          
            <p><a title="Andrew Cunningham" href="http://arstechnica.com/author/andrew_cunningham/" target="_blank">Andrew Cunningham</a> at Ars Technica has <a title=" Explaining iOS 8’s extensions: Opening the platform while keeping it secure" href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/06/explaining-ios-8s-extensions-opening-the-platform-while-keeping-it-secure/" target="_blank">a great, in-depth writeup on how extensions will work in iOS 8</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like all third-party apps on a non-jailbroken iPhone, all iOS extensions are downloaded from the App Store. The biggest limitation here is that Apple won’t allow developers to offer apps that are <em>just</em>extensions. Each extension has to live within a “containing app,” and Apple mandates that the containing app must offer some functionality to the user. Unlike in Android, developers cannot offer apps that are <em>just </em>widgets or <em>just</em> keyboards (this applies only to iOS; OS X developers can offer apps that are simply wrappers for extensions).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple has long been hesitant to let apps talk with each other because of security. It makes sense that in finally offering that type of communication, iOS would be forced to adhere to some strict rules.</p>

<p>This does answer a question I had: <em>Would it be possible for me to develop extensions for other apps (not owned by me)?</em> I guess a man can dream.</p>

          <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/smartphone-notifications/" class="post-link" target="_blank"><h3 class="h1 post-title">→ Why Notifications Are About to Rule the Smartphone Interface</h3></a>
        
        <p class="post-summary">
          
            <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/author/mathonan/">Mat Honan</a> on why iOS 8 will usher in the era of notifications as the most important smartphone interaction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we can interact with our data in short bursts via notifications, we make remarkable efficiency gains, especially on tasks that we perform again and again. Apps will become more about information and communications; we’re going to think of them as services instead of as windows onto our data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s true. Android has laid the ground work, but the tightly defined user experience in iOS is going to take this to a whole new level. Smartphone productivity is about to get a whole lot more productive.</p>
