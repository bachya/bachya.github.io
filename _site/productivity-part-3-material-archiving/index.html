  <p>You’re rolling now, aren’t you? Emails aren’t an issue anymore. Tasks and things to do? Under control. You’re enjoying a more productive (and ultimately, happy) life.</p>

<p><em>This is Part 3 in a 3 part series on productivity. <a href="/productivity-part-1-email-management/" title="Productivity, Part 1: Email Management">Part 1 covers email management</a> and <a href="/productivity-part-2-todo-management/" title="Productivity, Part 2: Todo Management">Part 2 covers todo management</a>.</em></p>

<p>There’s one more stop on our journey, however. For many, this destination is the hardest of all; it requires a powerful shift in one’s perspective. Adopting this strategy will need even more diligence than you’ve been asked to display thus far.</p>

<p>This destination is all about archiving. It’s about clearing the remaining clutter out of your mind, inbox, mailbox, bowl-on-the-kitchen-table, or wherever else you store it and putting it into a reliable system.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, you have <em>stuff</em> everywhere – receipts, old statements, articles you want to save, notes that you love and want to keep (but don’t want to have to store somewhere), recipes that you want to remember, emails that have a special or important meaning, and a trillion other items. The amount of clutter – physical or digital – is overwhelming; it all seems important, but you have no system for archiving it in a way conducive to retrieval later.</p>

<p>In the spirit of this series – reducing unnecessary burdens on the mind – I want to share my secret sauce for archiving these materials. Through much toil and headache, I’ve arrived at a system that allows me to store these important materials and easily recall them later.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Here’s how I use Evernote: as my material archive.</p>

<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>

<p>I’ve blogged about <a href="/tag/evernote/">Evernote-related topics</a> many times before; it might be the one application I cannot live without. It wasn’t always this way, however.</p>

<p>As always, allow me to start with the story of how Evernote came into my life.</p>

<p>I started using Evernote in grad school. At the time, I hated taking notes and paper. I needed something better; moreover, I needed something that could synchronize those notes between my old Macbook and my Windows PC. After some diligent Google searching, I found the green elephant.</p>

<p>I must admit: at first, I was not impressed. Perhaps my expectations were too out-there; perhaps I was looking for Evernote to be an all-around assistant, and not just a set of digital notebooks. Whatever the case, Evernote was quickly relegated to the “I ‘should’ like this, so I’ll keep it around, but never really use it” bin. It stayed like that for a long time.</p>

<p>Fast forward 3 years. I was knee-deep in my first job and swimming in <em>stuff</em>. I was archiving random bits of paper, printed emails, and other <em>stuff</em> in various manilla folders (and storing those folders rather haphazardly in my single filing cabinet). The worst came when I traveled; I would inevitably leave important documents back in that filing cabinet. I was forced to try to remember information on the fly. It was awful.</p>

<p>One day, a coworker said, “Why don’t you use Evernote to store all that stuff?” My mind froze. I was used to thinking of Evernote as “that tool that sounded neat, but I could never find a use for.” In that moment, however, I began to see something more; what if Evernote could be my digital filing cabinet? What if Evernote could be that intelligent, virtualized space that held all the <em>stuff</em> I needed to get rid of?</p>

<p>What I came up with has served me well to this day. Allow me to share it with you.</p>

<p>I assume that upon reading this, you have a rudimentary understanding of Evernote and its parts. If that isn’t the case, check out <a title="Evernote Knowledge Base" href="https://evernote.com/contact/support/kb/#!/product/evernote" target="_blank">Evernote’s Knowledge Base</a> before reading on.</p>

<p>Got it? Let’s go.</p>

<h2 id="gettingstuff-into-evernote">Getting Stuff Into Evernote</h2>

<p>To start, allow me to explain the various methods I use to get items into Evernote:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a title="Evernote Web Clipper" href="https://evernote.com/webclipper/" target="_blank">Evernote Web Clipper</a>:</strong> a supremely powerful extension that easily brings web pages, PDFs, Gmails, and more into Evernote.</li>
  <li><strong><a title="How to send email into Evernote" href="https://evernote.com/contact/support/kb/#/article/23480523" target="_blank">Via Email</a>:</strong> because every Evernote user gets their own email address, it’s easy to send emails directly into Evernote.</li>
  <li><strong><a title="Boxer" href="https://appcenter.evernote.com/app/boxer/ipad" target="_blank">Via Boxer</a>:</strong> in Boxer (the email client I use on my iPhone), I can swipe left or right to immediately send an email to Evernote. Simple!</li>
  <li><strong>Via <a title="Hazel" href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel" target="_blank">Hazel</a>:</strong> by using Hazel’s automation rules, I can set up a <strong>Send to Evernote</strong> directory; when any file gets placed in here, it automatically gets added to a new Evernote note (<a title="bachya/Code" href="https://github.com/bachya/Code/tree/master/hazel" target="_blank">check out my Github</a> to see the rules).</li>
  <li><strong>Via <a title="Drafts" href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/" target="_blank">Drafts</a>:</strong> many of my actions deal with Evernote notes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notebooks">Notebooks</h2>

<p>Some Evernote users like to have a new notebook for every new undertaking and every new project. I don’t work that way; instead, I keep a limited number of notebooks based on overall context.</p>

<p>My notebooks break into two categories: <strong>Personal</strong> and <strong>Work</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Notebooks</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Archive:</strong> my all-purpose personal life notebook; most of my non-work-related notes go in here.</li>
      <li><strong>Us:</strong> the notebook that I share with my wife; any notes that both need access to go in here.</li>
      <li><strong>House Inventory:</strong> a notebook full of pictures of valuable items in our house; we support this for when we ever need inventory info for insurance purposes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Work Notebooks</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Work Archive:</strong> my all-purpose work notebook; almost all of my work-related notes go in here.</li>
      <li><strong>How-To:</strong> a collection of “how-to” notes that I share with my colleagues.</li>
      <li><strong>Aaron &amp; *:</strong> a series of notebooks that I share with particular people; any notes that we both need access to go in their respective notebook.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it: 6 total notebooks run my archival needs. In general, I only create a new notebook when I need to share it with someone specific.</p>

<p>“Wait,” I can hear you say. “What about your various work projects? Personal projects? Aren’t they in need of their own notebook?”</p>

<p>Negative, dear reader. That’s where <strong>tags</strong> come into play.</p>

<h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>

<p>Tags are much like labels in Gmail: they attach a label to a particular note in Evernote. And, in the same way that Gmail labels are preferable to more traditional email folders, I find that Evernote tags are preferable to innumerable notebooks.</p>

<p>Here’s why: pretend you have a single note that details info on three different work projects. Since Evernote notes can only belong to one notebook, you’re in a pickle; which of your three project notebooks do you stick the note in? Do you (<strong>ugh</strong>) make <em>copies</em> of the note and place one in each notebook? (please say no…)</p>

<p>Tags, however, are different. A single note can have an unlimited number of tags applied to it. Look again at the previous example; what if, regardless of the container notebook, that note could be tagged with tags on all three projects? Suddenly, you have a much more flexible system.</p>

<p>That said, it is possible to go overboard with tags. In general, I try to keep a limited number.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>!Locations:</strong> has several sub-tags related to specific physical locations (e.g., <strong>!Home</strong>); when a note relates to that place, I tag it as such.</li>
  <li><strong>!People:</strong> has sub-tags related to specific people; when I keep something that relates to a specific person, that tag gets applied.</li>
  <li><strong>!Projects:</strong> has sub-tags for each project that I’m working on; I prefix them to decide whether they are personal or work projects (e.g., <strong>Personal:Sifttter-Redux</strong> or <strong>Work:ABC Company</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these larger tag groupings, I keep several common individual tags. Some of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>cards/notes:</strong> I tend to scan and save cards and notes people have given me; they get tagged with this tag (and, often, the tag from <strong>!People</strong> that relates to the giver).</li>
  <li><strong>gift-idea:</strong> gift ideas get tagged for easy retrieval later (again, with the related tag from <strong>!People</strong>).</li>
  <li><strong>manual:</strong> gets applied to all my scanned product manuals (a lifesaver, trust me).</li>
  <li><strong>product/license-key:</strong> gets applied to any license key that I receive (another lifesaver).</li>
  <li><strong>tax:</strong> gets applied to anything tax-related; when March 1st comes around, I merely check this tag and get everything I need.</li>
</ul>

<p>By applying the right combination of tags, notes become immediately more useful. The digital filing cabinet becomes far more useful than the standard physical one.</p>

<h2 id="just-the-beginning">Just The Beginning</h2>

<p>By being such an expansive, powerful, open-ended tool, Evernote is infinitely customizable (or nearly so). I have no doubt that in time, my system will change. That said, my current setup allows me to collect all the <em>stuff</em> that needs archiving, store it in a centralized place, tag it appropriately, and find it easily later on.</p>
