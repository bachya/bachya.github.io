<article class="post-content">
  <p>Once upon a time, I began to despise my iPhone’s home screens. Random apps, folders all over the place, no organization – it wasn’t <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>, and that’s what I despised most of all.</p>

<p>I Googled around. I read articles. I tried to see how others organized their apps. <a title="Organize Your IOS Homescreen With IEmpty Camouflaged Icons" href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/organize-your-ios-homescreen-with-iempty-camouflaged-icons/" target="_blank">Some went for graphical gimmicks</a>; <a title="How to: Organize your iPhone apps with less logic, more usability" href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/09/04/how-to-organise-your-iphone-apps-with-less-logic-more-usability/" target="_blank">some organized by occasion and not category</a>; <a title="How Do You Organize Your Smartphone's Home Screen?" href="http://lifehacker.com/5715135/how-do-you-organize-your-smartphones-home-screen" target="_blank">others tried different schemes, all the while swearing at how awesome those schemes were</a>. I didn’t begrudge anyone for their ideas; I just couldn’t get any of them to work for me. I had this cycling thought – again and again – for weeks. Today, this thought hit me again as I was sitting in a coffee shop: <em>I can’s stand all these apps and folders; what am I supposed to do with all of this?</em></p>

<p>While scanning my home screen, I came across <a title="Launch Center Pro" href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/" target="_blank">Launch Center Pro</a>. I downloaded this app about three months ago, purely because I liked the idea of it (a common problem of mine); unfortunately, I had no real use for it. <a title="LAUNCH CENTER PRO: AN ADOPTION STRATEGY FOR THOSE HAVING TROUBLE ADOPTING IT" href="http://nerdgap.com/launch-center-pro-an-adoption-strategy-for-those-having-trouble-adopting-it/" target="_blank">Then I read this article</a> and everything changed. In the span of a few hours, I had a layout to my iPhone that is useful, enjoyable, and doesn’t halt productivity. Reading a single article changed both how I viewed Launch Center Pro and how I approached organization.</p>

<p>Here’s the story of how this latest productivity boost came about.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>What follows is my explanation of how I use Launch Center Pro.</p>

<h2 id="launch-center-pro">Launch Center Pro</h2>

<p>Launch Center Pro bills itself as an app that speeds up common tasks on iOS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s like speed dial for everyday tasks. Launch Center Pro saves you time by launching complex actions in a single tap. Message a loved one, search Yelp for the nearest coffee shop, jump straight to the camera in Instagram, all with just a flick of your thumb. Create shortcuts for email, Safari, phone or FaceTime calls, Google searches, and more. If you do it on your phone constantly, Launch Center Pro will make it easier and faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tactically, this boils down to two main scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It can quickly launch apps.</li>
  <li>It can quickly execute specific actions within those apps.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’d originally focused on #2 being the only way Launch Center Pro could be useful; by mixing in #1, however, iOS can become a bit more organized. Time to dive into the details. First, as a precursor to understanding my new, cleaner iOS, let’s look at how my Launch Center Pro works.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-screen">The Main Screen</h2>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-585" src="/assets/2014/03/2014-03-08-20.56.38-576x1024.png" alt="Launch Center Pro - Main Screen" width="576" height="1024" /></p>

<p>I’ve organized my main Launch Center Pro screen into two different “loose sections”: individual actions (the first three rows) and grouped action pages (the remaining rows). First, let’s look at the individual actions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Drafts:</strong> Opens a new note in Drafts.</li>
  <li><strong>Search Wikipedia:</strong> Searches Wikipedia for the entered text.</li>
  <li><strong>Find Location:</strong> Searches Google Maps for the entered place.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are actions I do <em>constantly</em>; by adding them as shortcuts to Launch Center Pro, I save a lot of energy. Over time, I expect that I’ll find other individual actions that can occupy the first three rows of Launch Center Pro.</p>

<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-586" src="/assets/2014/03/2014-03-08-20.56.43-576x1024.png" alt="Launch Center Pro - Audio" width="576" height="1024" /></p>

<p><strong>Audio</strong> is straightforward page: it has shortcuts to anything that I listen to. It nicely mixes “app shortcuts” (i.e., shortcuts that merely open an app) and “custom shortcuts” (i.e., shortcuts that do a specific action within an app).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Audible:</strong> Opens Audible.</li>
  <li><strong>Downcast:</strong> Opens Downcast.</li>
  <li><strong>Spotify:</strong> Opens Spotify.</li>
  <li><strong>Search Spotify:</strong> Searches for the specified text on Spotify.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="call">Call</h2>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-587" src="/assets/2014/03/2014-03-08_20_47_13-576x1024.jpg" alt="Launch Center Pro - Call" width="576" height="1024" /></p>

<p><strong>Call</strong> is my page for dialing others. It has many shortcuts for calling my favorite people quickly, as well as two other shortcuts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dial With Keypad:</strong> Allows me to dial a number manually.</li>
  <li><strong>Dial Contact</strong><strong>:</strong> Allows me to quickly dial a contact in my address book.</li>
</ul>

<p>A nice added benefit of this page is that it allows me to remove the “Phone” app from my home screen (I was sick of that thing).</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-588" src="/assets/2014/03/2014-03-08-20.47.17-576x1024.png" alt="Launch Center Pro - Reading" width="576" height="1024" /></p>

<p><strong>Reading</strong> has shortcuts to the apps that I read often: <strong>Reeder 2</strong> for RSS feeds, <strong>Instapaper</strong> for saved articles, and <strong>Bible</strong> for my daily inspiration.</p>

<h2 id="social">Social</h2>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-590" src="/assets/2014/03/2014-03-08-20.47.31-576x1024.png" alt="Launch Center Pro - Social" width="576" height="1024" /></p>

<p><strong>Social</strong> has shortcuts to all of my social media apps. Simple enough.</p>

<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-591" src="/assets/2014/03/2014-03-08-20.47.34-576x1024.png" alt="Launch Center Pro - Productivity" width="576" height="1024" /></p>

<p><strong>Productivity </strong>is entirely composed of custom shortcuts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reminder:</strong> Creates a new reminder in Due.</li>
  <li><strong>Vitamin Cottage:</strong> Adds a new item to our grocery list (stored in Trello).</li>
  <li><strong>Create List</strong><strong>:</strong> Creates a new list in Clear.</li>
  <li><strong>Clipboard:</strong> Creates a new task in Todo (using the clipboard’s content as the title).</li>
  <li><strong>New Task:</strong> Creates a new task in Todo.</li>
  <li><strong>Follow Up With:</strong> Creates a specialized task in Todo that takes the form “Follow up with [person] re: [subject]”.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-592" src="/assets/2014/03/2014-03-08-20.47.41-576x1024.png" alt="Launch Center Pro - Tools" width="576" height="1024" /></p>

<p>The <strong>Tools</strong> page has shortcuts to my most commonly used “utility” apps. Nothing overly customized going on here; this page merely allows me to de-clutter my home screens.</p>

<h2 id="my-home-screens">My Home Screens</h2>

<p>With Launch Center Pro in full gear, I’ve whittled down my home screens to two.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-home-screen">The First Home Screen</h3>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-593" src="/assets/2014/03/2014-03-08-21.13.11-576x1024.png" alt="First Home Screen" width="576" height="1024" /></p>

<p>With so much being taken care of by Launch Center Pro, my first home screen is now composed of two main categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Dock</strong><strong>:</strong> These four apps (including Launch Center Pro) are what I want access to no matter what.</li>
  <li><strong>The Others:</strong> These other apps are important enough to have spots on the home screen, but not so important that they are included in Launch Center Pro.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-second-home-screen">The Second Home Screen</h3>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-594" src="/assets/2014/03/2014-03-08-21.13.33-576x1024.png" alt="Second Home Screen" width="576" height="1024" /></p>

<p>My second home screen is simply a filing cabinet for all my other apps; these are the items that I want to keep (especially in a categorized fashion), but aren’t vital enough to either (a) exist in Launch Center Pro or (b) have spots on the first home screen.</p>

<h2 id="launch-center-pro-to-the-rescue">Launch Center Pro to the rescue?</h2>

<p>Time will tell if Launch Center Pro remains in my workflow. It’s not a perfect tool, but much of that is due to iOS’ overly restrictive nature. That said, it’s given me new hope that my iPhone can once again be a productive environment.</p>
