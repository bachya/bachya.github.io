  <p>I went to <a title="TEDxMileHigh 2014" href="http://www.tedxmilehigh.com/" target="_blank">TEDxMileHigh 2014</a> this weekend. As with any TED-sponsored event, it’s difficult not to be impressed by the level of critical thinking, keen insight, and intellectual curiosity that comes out of the speakers. That impression, however, is only part of the equation for me. As much as I like these events, they give rise to an age-old struggle of mine.</p>

<p>You see, I have a problem of ideation.<sup id="fnref-1380-1"><a href="#fn-1380-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I see others create brilliant ideas (seemingly out of nowhere) and I immediately degrade myself for not being able to do the same. It seems a simple thing, but it isn’t; it’s deep-seated. It’s a problem of the world and of the heart.</p>

<p>I think it’s time I finally explore what it’s really all about.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>It’s time to reflect on my age-old struggle: why do I have a passion to create things <em>and</em> a sense that I can’t fulfill those passions?</p>

<h2 id="the-origins-of-struggle">The Origins of Struggle</h2>

<p>My whole life, I’ve struggled at coming up with my one, great idea.</p>

<p>When I was in high school, I saw <a title="Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120915/" target="_blank">Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace</a><sup id="fnref-1380-2"><a href="#fn-1380-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and instantly became obsessed with the idea of writing the next great space opera. That very day, I bought a brand new, spiral-bound notebook, sharpened my pencil, and sat down to get after it.</p>

<p>Three hours and several ripped-out-and-crumpled-sheets later, I was no closer. All I’d done was recreate Star Wars (which is a bad idea for most experienced writers, much less a bushy-tailed 14-year-old). I was crushed; my screenwriting dream was not off to a good start.</p>

<p>I wrote other stories with laser-focus along the way, but truth be told, none of them had a shred of originality. My novella about a dark journey through the underworld? A silly knockoff of <a title="Grim Fandango" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango" target="_blank">Grim Fandango</a>. My screenplay about a geologist who stumbles on a 10,000-year-old civilization below the crust of the earth? Nope; not-so-loosely related to <a title="http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-TiAna-Myst/dp/0786889209" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-TiAna-Myst/dp/0786889209" target="_blank">The Book of Ti’Ana</a><sup id="fnref-1380-3"><a href="#fn-1380-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. My sprawling, quasi-medieval epic about betrayal in a kingdom on the brink of destruction? Wrong; long before <a title="A Game of Thrones" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones" target="_blank">Game of Thrones</a> became popular, <a title="Final Fantasy Tactics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_fantasy_tactics" target="_blank">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> inspired me in a way my mind couldn’t recreate.</p>

<p>Years passed and with each one, I cast more ideas into the trash. Frustration set in a way I’d never experienced before.</p>

<h2 id="continuing-on">Continuing On</h2>

<p>In high school, my love of technology finally met up with a burgeoning ability to wield it. I’d left my screenwriting career behind in favor of something newer-and-hipper: website creation. These were the days before Web 2.0; one’s ability to write CSS put him in an elite class, and for high school students, this manifested itself in one primary arena: <a title="LiveJournal" href="http://www.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">LiveJournal</a> themes.<sup id="fnref-1380-4"><a href="#fn-1380-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Create a custom theme and you were in the game.</p>

<p>Many of my friends were already in the game. I was behind the eight-ball; despite some random experiments with <a title="Adobe Photoshop" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Photoshop</a> some years earlier<sup id="fnref-1380-5"><a href="#fn-1380-5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, I had about zero design experience. However, that same voice came calling, “Aaron: this is where you want to be. You were <em>meant</em> to be here.” I had the talent (I thought) and I had the want; it was time to meet the challenge.</p>

<p>Like writing screenplays and other stories, I quickly descended to a bad place. I hated everything I created. I watched my friends create better, more pleasing designs (and have fun doing it) and began to hate not only the game, but the player (me), too. A simple thing – designing themes for a journalism website (for fun, I might add) – had taken on something toxic.</p>

<p>Ideation began to sour and I began to stop trying.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-glimmer">The First Glimmer</h2>

<p>In college, things began to change. Not long after I joined the University of Colorado, I hooked up with <a title="The Colorado Engineer" href="https://cem.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">The Colorado Engineer</a><sup id="fnref-1380-6"><a href="#fn-1380-6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> (CEM) with the intent of designing article layouts. I wasn’t the greatest to ever come along, but next to my engineer brethren (intellectually brilliant people, but in awe of anyone with basic Photoshop skills), I looked pretty decent. I designed a few layouts and got some praise; it felt good.</p>

<p>Not long after, I undertook the initiative to redesign CEM’s website. With this project, I hit gold. I produced a site design that, although pedestrian by today’s standards, was 1,000,000% better than what had existed before. My pride began to swell; I was finally starting to realize my talent (which I <em>knew</em> had existed all along).</p>

<p>This pride went to a new level when, in my Sophomore year, I joined the <a title="ATLAS Institute" href="http://atlas.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">ATLAS</a> program at CU. I’d found heaven with the program; it offered opportunities to delve into topics that my Computer Science curriculum averted: web design, graphic design, audio engineering, video production, and more. As I progressed through the program, I developed a name for myself; people knew me as a subject matter expert! It was an unbelievable feeling. By the time I’d graduated from the program in my Senior year, I believed I’d go down as a shining example of what ATLAS prizes (and can produce) in a student.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, this period coincided with another fundamental experience of my Senior year: meeting God.</p>

<h2 id="a-quandary">A Quandary</h2>

<p>That year, God put a big lesson on me. Though it took many more years for the lesson to sink into my heart, that brush with Jesus’ view on pride came via the Apostle Paul:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But we will not boast beyond limits, but will boast only with regard to the area of influence God assigned to us, to reach even to you. — 2 Corinthians 10:13</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn’t like this. I was <em>finally</em> in a place where my skills of creation were commensurate with my want to create. I felt powerful. I felt <em>justified</em>. “I’ve suffered long enough,” I thought. And besides: didn’t God want me to be successful? Didn’t He hate that I beat myself into the ground when I failed at all those creative endeavors? Why shouldn’t I be excited<sup id="fnref-1380-7"><a href="#fn-1380-7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> about my newfound success in an area that had previously only given pain?</p>

<p>That didn’t sit for very long. That was selfish and I knew it. Unfortunately, I didn’t really dig any further; I left it there.</p>

<h2 id="the-realization">The Realization</h2>

<p>Fast forward to this weekend’s TEDx event. One image stands in my mind: a 17-year-old kid from Fairview High School explaining how he’s invented a new method for antibiotics that is far more advanced than anything we have today. I left with one thought: “What exactly was <em>I</em> doing in high school?”</p>

<p>I convinced myself that I was merely impressed with the kid (and the other speakers I’d seen that day).</p>

<p>I was lying.</p>

<p>You see, that dark whatever-it-is is still in me. I might have grown in many ways, but that <em>thing</em> pops up constantly. It popped up the last time I tried to write an iOS app. It popped up when I thought about creating this blog. Shoot, it’s popping up even now: “Aaron, this is a bunch of noise; no one cares about this crap.”</p>

<p>And as I sit here, hammering this out, something is becoming clear to me: if I create apps, build companies, and speak at important events with important people, or if I simply do the best I can with what I have, the focus has to be God.</p>

<p>One side of that coin seems especially clear: I am too susceptible to arrogant self-destruction when I focus on my own value/worth/etc.; therefore, my ideas and my creations can’t be where I place my worth. The other side of that coin is new to me: if I’m not producing anything world-changing at the moment, who’s to say it’s a waste?</p>

<p>If I fail to produce an award-winning app, but make my wife feel special, am I really a failure?</p>

<p>If I fail to become a world-known name, but have time to share a meal with friends every now and again, is my life really “not where I want it to be”?</p>

<p>If others seem to do the things and have the experiences that I fear not having, but I can be content with my life, is that not worth savoring?</p>

<p>A new perspective has arrived this weekend<sup id="fnref-1380-8"><a href="#fn-1380-8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>. In every moment, I have the opportunity to serve God and bring light to my corner of the world. If that occurs through something earth-shattering, great; if not, great. Contentment needs to come whether I’m known or unknown. To that end, my passion for creation must be directed toward God and not my own selfishness.</p>

<p>This is a hard perspective for me to take, folks. Even now, there’s a voice saying, “Come on. If you really have that perspective, you’ll go nowhere (and you’ll have no one to blame but yourself).”</p>

<p>But I know that’s a lie. It has to be.</p>

<p>And so, I march on. I’ll continue to write little bits of software, craft stories here and there, design art when the inspiration strikes, and rest when the inspiration is a little dry. And I’ll be okay with that. God has given me a perspective of peace and contentment worth more than all of that. Through it all, He remains why I “do it.”</p>

<p>That can be good enough for me.</p>
