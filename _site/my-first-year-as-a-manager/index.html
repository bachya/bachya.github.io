  <p>It’s hard to believe that became a manager 19 months ago. In some ways, it feels like not long ago; it also feels like I’ve done it my whole life.</p>

<p>Learning to lead others is an immense challenge. For the first several months, a part of me feared screwing the thing up. It wasn’t “hearts in coolers”, as they say, but the professional livelihood of several people I cared about was partly in my hands. Becoming a manager has been a journey and the lessons have been many.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>My first year and a half as a manager has taught me a great amount; I want to share it</p>

<h2 id="snippets">Snippets</h2>

<h2 id="don8217t-lead-from-the-front8230or-the-back">#1. Don’t lead from the front…or the back.</h2>

<p>A while back, I found this image on a Gawker site:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" title="Be a Manager From the Front" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18psrbhjdeww6jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" alt="Be a Manager From the Front" width="640" height="640" /></p>

<p>The graphic resonated with me; I wanted to lead from the front (as an example to my folks), not as a tyrant who drives from the back. This is the type of manager and leader I aspire to be.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>One of my flaws: I have trouble sharing accolades with others. If I didn’t pay attention, I would reap the glory of being a leader. Because of this, leading from the front (in and of itself) is a dangerous place for me. It provides an opportunity for me to take credit for the hard work of my team.</p>

<p>I’m reminded of servant leadership:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Servant leadership</strong> is both a leadership philosophy and set of leadership practices. Traditional leadership generally involves the accumulation and exercise of power by one at the “top of the pyramid.” By comparison, the servant-leader shares power, puts the needs of others first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible.</p>

  <p>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the lesson learned: sometimes, coaching a team means leading them into the fight; at other times, it means falling back and letting them shine. Knowing when to do each is the trick; a successful manager moves between them as needed. The sole focus remains the same: sharing power, putting the needs of others first, and developing the term to perform as highly as possible.</p>

<h2 id="you8217re-going-to-be-wrong-tell-it-straight">#2. You’re going to be wrong. Tell it straight.</h2>

<p>I took a calculated risk when I inherited my team: in our “team kickoff” meeting, I said, “Guys, I’m about to make a lot of mistakes. I need you to keep me honest and to help me grow as is proper.” Walking away from that meeting, I remember thinking, <em>Did I do the right thing? Did I just destroy my team’s image of me?</em></p>

<p>I don’t have a definitive answer, but after these many months, I think I did the right thing.</p>

<p>A manager has to straddle the line between being straightforward with his teams and portraying strength/knowledge/etc. Despite that, it’s important to admit that as a human being, he is going to be wrong. It sets appropriate expectations and demonstrates that the manager is a real person.</p>

<h2 id="be-the-rock-and-the-shield">#3. Be the rock and the shield.</h2>

<p>I’ve been nervous at various points in my management career. Nothing catastrophic, but my very human self has struggled at various points. One common theme I’ve taken away: if I can stop struggles – my own, or perpetrated by others – from reaching my team, then that needs to be my primary objective.</p>

<p>If I’m having a rough day, it has to stop before it hits my team.</p>

<p>If I’m dealing with a difficult company situation, I cannot allow that difficulty to affect my team.</p>

<p>If other groups in the company are storming, I must shield my team from that.</p>

<p>In order for my team to perform at a high level, they need protection, encouragement, strength, and courage. It’s my job to provide them that, regardless of what’s going on around us.</p>

<h2 id="fire-is-usually-not-the-answer">#4. Fire is usually not the answer.</h2>

<p>In my career, I’ve had the opportunity to watch some leaders unleash hell on their straggling employees. I’ve watched confidence shatter, moods drop, and overall performance suffer because of this fiery response to team struggle.</p>

<p>I don’t ever want to  be that type of manager.</p>

<p>“Professional assertiveness” is the name of the game. When a part of my team is struggling, we speak honestly about it. I share my expectations <em>and</em> my confidence that my teammate can meet (and beat) them. 99% of the time, that quiet, assertive confidence boosts those people. I’ve watched it happen many times – I’ve watched people who had previously struggled soar higher than they thought possible.</p>

<p>It’s awesome to see what happens when a manager forgoes fire in favor of refined encouragement.</p>

<h2 id="walking-meetings-are-awesome">#5. Walking meetings are awesome.</h2>

<p>Some of my most productive meetings with my team have come on a walk. I’ve read articles saying that this isn’t possible; without a notepad/computer/phone/etc., how can a productive meeting take place? “Meetings need to be in a conference room, at a table,” they say. A manager should be “more professional” than that.</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>There are, of course, times for those meetings. But in general, the meetings where we stretch our legs, talk about issues, and share life together are the most meaningful. We both leave those meetings more energized, solid, and steady. On a personal level, we connect more easily when we’re sharing even the simple experience of walking outside.</p>

<h2 id="just-the-beginning">Just the Beginning</h2>

<p>One year has taught me these lessons; at 28 years of age, I’m sure I’ll learn several other crucial lessons. My committed goal remains the same: to elevate the performance and perspective of my team. Every action, every day (even on my bad days), needs to point back to this.</p>

<p>Let’s do this.</p>
