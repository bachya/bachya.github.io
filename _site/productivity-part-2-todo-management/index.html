  <p>If you’ve come this far, you’ve presumably got your email under control; your inbox is clean and everything is where it needs to be. But those emails aren’t going to complete themselves (nor will the thousand other things you need to get done). You need a system to help you remember what needs to get done, when.</p>

<p><em>This is Part 2 in a 3 part series on productivity. <a href="/productivity-part-1-email-management/" title="Productivity, Part 1: Email Management">Part 1 covers email management</a> and <a href="/productivity-part-3-material-archiving/">Part 3 covers material archiving</a>.</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the world of todo management, my friends; it’s the next stop on our journey toward a more productive and stress-free life.</p>

<p>Todo management is, quite simply, a system that allows you to track, rank, and ultimately complete all the things you need to get done.</p>

<p>As with email management, I’m going to give you my story as an example.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>A good todo system is critical to productivity; in that vein, I introduce my longtime GTD companion, Toodledo.</p>

<h2 id="the-holy-grail-of-productivity">The Holy Grail of Productivity</h2>

<p>While in grad school, I read to David Allen’s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity-ebook/dp/B000WH7PKY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392671548&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=getting+the+things+done" target="_blank">Getting Things Done</a>. GTD, as it’s more commonly known, is a system for managing life’s clutter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GTD<sup>®</sup> is the shorthand brand for “Getting Things Done<sup>®</sup>,” the groundbreaking work-life management system by David Allen that provides concrete solutions for transforming overwhelm and uncertainty into an integrated system of stress-free productivity.</p>

  <p>GTD is a powerful method to manage commitments, information, and communication. It is the result of thirty years of consulting services, private coaching, training, and organizational programs with millions of people internationally. It has earned a reputation as the gold standard in personal and organizational productivity.</p>

  <p>GTD enables greater performance, capacity, and innovation. It alleviates the feeling of overwhelm, instilling focus, clarity, and confidence.</p>

  <p>Source: <a href="http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd" target="_blank">David Allen, Co.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highly recommend this book, but to give a synopsis, it prescribes a basic strategy: get all the various cruft of life – emails, paperwork, todo items, etc. – and get them into a system that allows you to tackle them strategically.</p>

<p><a href="/productivity-part-3-material-archiving/">I had email covered</a>. I didn’t have a ton of paperwork at the time. The only glaringly missing thing was todo management. When I think about it, I’m shocked that I managed to get all my school assignments done; most of the time, I “remembered” them via scraps of paper or, worst of all, in my head. No wonder I was stressed.</p>

<p>I spent almost a year trying to get a handle on a productive todo system. To be truthful, I wasn’t very scientific about it. I tried different methods, different apps, different platforms, but always came back to the same problem: I looking to software to change a behavior issue. I’d added another layer – “todo system” – to my already overflowing todo pile. I gave little thought to organizing this information; everything was highly important and due “right now.” When I failed to do what I’d set out to, I’d simply defer it to the next day and hope for the best.</p>

<h2 id="post-grad-school-and-no-real-answer">Post-Grad School and No Real Answer</h2>

<p>I somehow graduated and found myself a great job. But my system for managing the things (both personal and professional) that I wanted to get done was in shambles. I knew that I wouldn’t survive unless I started getting this mess under control.</p>

<p>My system in those days was crude. I reformatted it several times over the course of two years, trying <em>more</em> methodologies, <em>more</em> apps, <em>more</em> styles, etc. Finally, through toil and sweat, I arrived at a GTD-esque implementation that works well. It will most certainly continue to grow, but it has finally allowed me to enjoy a state of productivity that is both useful and stress-reducing.</p>

<h2 id="my-system-for-todo-management">My System for Todo Management</h2>

<p>A quick note before we begin. My todo system makes use of a specific app: <a href="http://www.toodledo.com" target="_blank">Toodledo</a>. I love it for its flexibility, configurability, and cross-platform compatibility. Covering all of Toodledo would take many posts, so I’m going to gloss over much of the nuts-and-bolts detail; what I share here is the framework for my particular use cases.</p>

<p>There are many GTD apps out there and many of them coerced to do what I prescribe here.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="the-goal">The Goal</h4>

<p>Before diving into the nitty-gritty, let me outline the purpose for this system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It should allow me to easily input todos through two primary mechanisms: manual entry and <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/info/help_email.php" target="_blank">email-based entry</a>.</li>
  <li>It should allow me to distinguish between personal and professional todos.</li>
  <li>It should allow me to distinguish between todos that are doable by me and those that rely on others.</li>
  <li>It should show me todos that I’ve delegated to others and are overdue by 3 days or more.</li>
  <li>It should allow me to define custom searches for todos.</li>
  <li><strong>Most Importantly: it should allow me to focus on only the todos that are (a) due today or overdue, (b) earmarked by me to do today, or (c) delegated to someone else and overdue.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We’re covering a lot of info here. Once we set up the foundation, I’ll show examples of what it looks like in action.</p>

<h4 id="todosvs-projects">Todos vs. Projects</h4>

<p>Before we jump into creating a GTD-based todo management system, it is important to grasp the separation between todos and projects. Toodledo’s website provides a great synopsis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to author David Allen, the difference between a project and a todos is that “you don’t actually do a project; you can only do action steps related to it.” A project is something that requires more than one action step to complete.</p>

  <p>Source: <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/info/gtd.php" target="_blank">Toodledo</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an important concept. You don’t want to jump into your new todo system and have “todos” that are too immense to consider (like “Write my new book”). Break it down into subtasks and you’ll be grateful later.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-the-fields">Step 1: The Fields</h3>

<p>Toodledo allows users to attach an enormous amount of metadata (in the form of <strong>Fields</strong>). Through painful experience, I’ve learned that too much todo detail is as bad as too little; therefore, I’ve whittled down my system to use 7 primary Fields:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-5.34.28-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-393 " src="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-5.34.28-PM.png" alt="Toodledo: Fields" width="496" height="294" /></a></p>

<p>I use these Fields for very specific purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Folder:</strong> used to create todo lists (described in <a href="#lists">Step 2</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Context:</strong> used to define an overall group for a todo (described in <a href="#contexts">Step 3</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Start Date:</strong> used for a special purpose in delegated todos</li>
  <li><strong>Due Date:</strong> used to assign a hard due date to a todo</li>
  <li><strong>Due Time:</strong> used to assign a hard due time to a todo</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> used to define a pattern for repeating a todo</li>
  <li><strong>Star:</strong> used to define a “next action” todo that I want to focus on</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="lists"></a></p>

<h3 id="step-2-the-folders">Step 2: The Folders</h3>

<p>The first step in our system is to create various lists for todos. I’ve landed on a slight variation of GTD’s suggested lists that is elegant, straightforward, and not overly verbose:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ticklers</li>
  <li>Actions</li>
  <li>Projects</li>
  <li>Waiting For/Delegated</li>
  <li>Someday/Maybe</li>
</ol>

<p>In Toodledo, these lists exist as <strong>Folders</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-6.09.04-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-400 " src="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-6.09.04-PM.png" alt="Toodledo: Folders" width="713" height="194" /></a></p>

<p>Note that I use incrementing numbers in front of my Folder names; I do this so that I can sort them in the way that I like.</p>

<h4 id="ticklers">1. Ticklers</h4>

<p><strong>Purpose: to hold “soft reminders” (items that I want to appear on a certain date, yet aren’t immediately “next actions”)</strong></p>

<p>A “tickler” is, I think, a hard concept to grasp. David Allen’s description is, I think, a little old-fashioned and not all that clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Tickler File allows you to hold physical reminders of things you want to see or remember–not now, but in the future. It can be an extremely functional tool, allowing you to in effect set up your own post office and “mail” things to yourself for receipt on a designated future date. David Allen has personally used a Tickler File system for years and considers it an indispensable component of his workflow.</p>

  <p>Source: <a href="http://secure.davidco.com/store/catalog/GTD-TICKLER-FILE-FOLDERS-p-16575.php" target="_blank">David Allen, Co.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great… What does that mean?</p>

<p>I think that ticklers made more sense in a world where physical inboxes were the primary source of “inflow.” That’s not my world. So, I’ve adapted: ticklers are for “soft reminders.”</p>

<p>Example: if a book is to be released later this year (and I want to remember), I put that item (along with a due date) into my tickler. When the time comes, my system will show that todo to me and I can decide then and there whether I want to do anything about it.</p>

<h4 id="actions">2. Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Purpose: to hold “next action” todos</strong></p>

<p>This folder is the workhorse of my todo system. Every todo that I need to check off goes in here. An important note: this Folder has both todos that have hard due dates <em>and</em> those that don’t.</p>

<p>Note that this is where the <strong>Star</strong> column comes into play. When I want to focus on a todo, I star it. That’s my sign that it’s a “next action” todo that I’m going to focus on completing. This is useful by itself, but becomes especially more useful when applied to my <a href="#better-hotlist">Better Hotlist</a>.</p>

<h4 id="projects">3. Projects</h4>

<p><strong>Purpose: to hold projects</strong></p>

<p>I keep a list of todos that are really projects. I do this so I can always have a list of what projects I’m working on. Toodledo allows for subtasks, which makes it (fairly) easy to assign todos to each of these projects.</p>

<p>Because these items are just tasks in Toodledo, I always prefix projects with a “+” symbol (e.g., <strong>+ My Blog</strong>).</p>

<h4 id="waitingdelegated">4. Waiting/Delegated</h4>

<p><strong>Purpose: to hold todos that are waiting on other people</strong></p>

<p>Many times, there are todos that I want to keep an eye on, even if they are no longer doable by me. This Folder (along with some trickery I will describe later) allows me to do just that.</p>

<p>In my case, I use the <strong>Start Date</strong> field to track when I delegated the todo. This comes in handy later on when applied to my <a href="#better-hotlist">Better Hotlist</a>. Note that I don’t use <strong>Due Date</strong> for this purpose; I used to, but when delegated todos would take time, they would seem as overdue on <em>my</em> list. That isn’t pleasing.</p>

<h4 id="somedaymaybe">5. Someday/Maybe</h4>

<p><strong>Purpose: to item that are not next actions (</strong>too large/complex/off-in-the-distance/etc.)<strong>, but that I want to think about further</strong></p>

<p>A key point to this Folder is that these items do not have due dates; these are meant for my consideration at some indeterminate point in the future.
<a name="contexts"></a></p>

<h3 id="step-3-the-contexts">Step 3: The Contexts</h3>

<p>Contexts in the GTD world are “‘tags’ you put on the items on your next actions lists saying where the action can be done, or what equipment you need to perform it.”</p>

<p>The purpose of a Context is to filter your todos based on where you and what you have available. Going to run an errand? Filter your Contexts to show only <strong>Errands </strong>todos and you can see any other errands that need to run. Want to get some work done on a plane? Filter your Contexts to show only <strong>Computer Without Internet</strong> todos.</p>

<p>The possibilities are limitless with Contexts. That said, in my early GTD days, I went overboard: I had Contexts for every possible scenario. Over time, I found that I was adding metadata for metadata’s sake. So, these days, I roll with only two: <strong>Personal</strong> and <strong>Work</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-6.10.49-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-403 " src="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-6.10.49-PM.png" alt="Toodledo: Contexts" width="710" height="89" /></a></p>

<h3 id="step-4-saved-searches">Step 4: Saved Searches</h3>

<p>One of Toodledo’s best features, in my opinion, are Saved Searches: customized views of todos that meet certain criteria. These Saved Searches are even synchronized to the iOS Toodledo app. Although the possibilities are limitless, I’m going to focus on the two Saved Searches I use the most.
<a name="better-hotlist"></a></p>

<h4 id="the-better-hotlist">The Better Hotlist</h4>

<p>I previously mentioned that the ideal todo management system would only show me the things I cared about for that day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tasks in my inbox (i.e., todos that haven’t been processed yet)</li>
  <li>Tasks due today (or overdue)</li>
  <li>Tasks I want to work on today, but don’t have hard deadlines</li>
  <li>Delegated todos that are overdue by 3 days or more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Toodledo goes part of the way by offering the Hotlist, a customizable todo view designed to get you to focus. Unfortunately, it’s a little rigid for my purposes, so I created a Saved Search that makes a better one:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-6.17.36-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-404 " src="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-6.17.36-PM.png" alt="Toodledo: A Better Hotlist" width="646" height="281" /></a></p>

<p>This Saved Search matches todos that meet any of the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tasks that have been starred (i.e., todos that have been marked by me as “next action”)</li>
  <li>Tasks that have a due date of today</li>
  <li>Tasks that have a due date before yesterday (i.e., todos that are overdue)</li>
  <li>Tasks that have not been assigned to a Folder (this is my “inbox”)</li>
  <li>Tasks that have a Start Date greater than 3 days ago and belong to the <strong>4. Waiting/Delegated</strong> folder</li>
</ul>

<p>This Saved Search is my constant companion; it is open throughout the day.</p>

<h4 id="next-action-candidates">Next Action Candidates</h4>

<p>This Saved Search allows me to have a pool of next actions that are ready for my review:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-7.11.12-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-407 " src="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-7.11.12-PM.png" alt="Toodledo: Next Action Candidates" width="582" height="236" /></a></p>

<p>This Saved Search matches todos that meet all the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tasks that have not been checked off (might seem silly, but since Toodledo allows you to view completed todos, it’s not)</li>
  <li>Tasks that are not starred (I don’t want to see todos that I’ve already earmarked for action today)</li>
  <li>Tasks that are not in the <strong>1. Ticklers</strong> folder</li>
  <li>Tasks that are not in the <strong>1. Waiting/Delegated</strong> folder</li>
  <li>Tasks that do not have a “+” in their name (which, as I mentioned before, are what I use to denote projects)</li>
  <li>Tasks that do not have a due date (since those will already be “next action” on that date)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-system-in-action">The System in Action</h2>

<p>My system is large and has a lot of moving parts. Now that you are associated with them, let’s see how this looks in life. We’ll be starting without any presumptions; this will be an effective blank system.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at the Better Hotlist:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-7.24.43-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-410 " src="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-7.24.43-PM.png" alt="Toodledo: Todos in the Inbox" width="754" height="162" /></a></p>

<p>I’ve got 5 todos in the inbox. Let’s process them:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Pick up apples</strong>. This is a todo that I’d like to do, but not necessarily right now. I change its Folder to <strong>2. Actions</strong>, and change its Context to <strong>Personal</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Have Bob look into expense reports</strong>. I asked Bob to do this on 2/13, so I change its Folder to <strong>4. Waiting/Delegated</strong>, change its Context to <strong>Work</strong>, and set its Start Date to <strong>2/13/2014</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Call Auntie Gretchen</strong>. This is something that I’d like to do today, so I <strong>star</strong> it, change its Folder to <strong>2. Actions</strong>, and change its Context to <strong>Personal</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Pay my credit card</strong>. I need to do this on the 17th (and every month on the 17th afterwards). I change its Folder to <strong>2. Actions</strong>, change its Context to <strong>Personal</strong>, set its Due Date to <strong>2/17</strong>, and set its Repeat to <strong>Monthly</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Write a book about pickles</strong>. This is too large to be a todo; it’s a project. So, I change its Title to <strong>+ Pickles Book</strong>, change its Folder to <strong>3. Projects</strong>, and change its Context to <strong>Personal</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once done, I refresh Toodledo by hitting the “r” key:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-7.36.25-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-412 " src="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-7.36.25-PM.png" alt="Toodledo: Processed Inbox" width="791" height="139" /></a></p>

<p>Bingo! Remembering the rules of the Better Hotlist, I now only see items that I want to see for today.</p>

<p>If we skip ahead to 2/17 (and pretend that we didn’t complete any todos in the meantime), the Better Hotlist looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-7.40.58-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-413 " src="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-7.40.58-PM.png" alt="Toodledo: 2/17" width="779" height="132" /></a></p>

<p>Notice how my todo to pay my credit card has appeared; additionally, since the todo for Bob is now more than 3 days “old” it shows up again (as a way of reminding me to look into it).</p>

<p>With these items complete, let’s look at the Next Action Candidates Saved Search:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-7.59.51-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-419 " src="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-7.59.51-PM.png" alt="Toodledo: Next Action Candidates" width="771" height="482" /></a></p>

<p>Remembering that these are items without hard due dates (and thus, are up to my discretion), I choose to install TurboTax, reconcile my Discover statement, and reschedule my haircut to finish off the day. I simply <strong>star</strong> them and go back to the Better Hotlist:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-8.04.01-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-421 " src="/assets/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-8.04.01-PM.png" alt="Toodledo: More Todos" width="757" height="157" /></a></p>

<p>Clean, fresh, and stress-free!</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-the-system">Benefits of the System</h2>

<p>When I think about this system, I get seriously giddy. Here’s why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don’t have to remember things in my head. <em>What do I need to do tomorrow? Did Bob answer my expense report question? When do I need to pick up the dry cleaning?</em> These are all irrelevant questions; the system tracks it for me.</li>
  <li>It allows me to track the things I need to do <em>and</em> the things I’m waiting on others to do. Nothing slips through the cracks.</li>
  <li>No more random scraps of paper, random Notepad files, or any other random list.</li>
  <li>My sleep has improved since implementing this. Seriously. There’s something to be said for getting stuff out of your head.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ready">Ready?</h2>

<p>A good todo system may take a bit more than a good email system. That’s okay; it’s going to <em>that</em> important. Take some time and play around. You may find a completely different system than this one; as long as it gives you stress-free productivity, you’re golden.</p>

<p>Let me know how it goes!</p>
