**Once upon a time, I had a dream of starting a blog. In that blog, I would share life (as best I could). I would deliver my story, with all of its interests, quirks, and insights, all in the hopes that it would make someone’s day just a little better.**

**This is my story and a bit about me.**

My first passion is God. Daily, He gives me ways to improve my small corner of the world. I chase after them, not because I’m forced to, but because my love for Him inspires me to do it. My mission is clear: to support, love, lift up, and “be there” for those around me.

My second passion is my wife. She is the reason this blog exists; without her prompting, encouragement, and excitement, it would have forever sat in a sad, cold, lonely place called “I’ll Try To Get There Someday”. She is my great love, my best friend, my partner, and if she is proud of me, it’s more than I could ever deserve.

My third passion is my family (both the family I was born into and the “friend family” that I’ve gained since). I love them; I couldn’t be whole without them. A long time ago, I heard a pastor say that when life fell apart at 3am, it was important to know who you could rely on. I can rely on these folks.

My fourth passion is technology. I got a computer science degree, mainly because I didn’t know what else to do at the time. Over time, I began to admire the things that technology could do. My love for apps, programs, software tools, blogs, technological automation, and all things “tech” inspires me and drives me forward.

My fifth passion is my home state of Colorado. I’ve traveled to nearly every state in the U.S.A. and without fail, every time I’ve come home, I’ve breathed a sigh of happiness. This place is beautiful. It’s full of people who share the same love of culture, good food, community, “outdoorsiness”, and contentment.

My sixth passion is dancing in a wild, crazy fashion. This should explain the picture above.
