*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

  * **<a href="http://github.com/mojombo/chronic" target="_blank">Chronic</a>.** I recently started to develop apps in the Ruby programming language. Of the many things to love are Gems (bundles of functionality given away for free). This one – which allows for natural language parsing of dates (e.g., &#8220;last Thursday&#8221; equaling &#8220;2/13/2014&#8221;) – is awesome.
  * **<a href="http://verytinymachines.com/numerical/" target="_blank">Numerical</a>.** It&#8217;s always interesting to see new entrants into crowded app markets. This calculator app shouldn&#8217;t have appealed to me, but a combination of beautiful design and great functionality is winning me over.

I struggle with saying &#8220;no&#8221; all the time. This article says it best: it&#8217;s a debilitating habit that needs to be addressed, stat.

  * **<a href="http://www.themostnorthernplace.com/" target="_blank">The Most Northern Place</a>.** A deeply moving piece for your consideration. Part cinema, part website, part motion graphics&#8230;it&#8217;s amazing.
