According to Business Insider, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-and-twitter-user-statistics-2014-5" target="_blank">Instagram believes it will soon eclipse Twitter</a>:

> Management at Instagram believes its user base will eventually grow to 1 billion monthly active users — making the photo sharing app far, far bigger than Twitter.

If this ends up being true, I think it highlights so many important lessons:

**The Medium.** Imagery is more powerful than words, even in the 21st Century. Although Twitter allows photos to exist with tweets, it is not a fundamentally visual platform like Instagram is.

**Skill Building.** Even if illusory, Instagram makes Average Joe believe he is a better photographer; no one is under the presumption that Twitter makes him a better writer.<sup id="fnref-958-1"><a href="#fn-958-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> That type of persuasiveness carries power.

**Outside Assets.** Twitter truly shot itself in the foot when it shunned its biggest asset: its developer community.<sup id="fnref-958-2"><a href="#fn-958-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Instagram doesn&#8217;t have nearly the same third-party power; one has to wonder if Twitter destroyed a huge advantage.

**Staleness.** An interesting idea to consider is that Instagram and Twitter&#8217;s primary rival – Facebook – is wobbling. Today&#8217;s culture wants specific, targeted interaction, and Facebook doesn&#8217;t offer that.
