[Lauren Orsini][1] with [ReadWrite][2] on [the rise and fall of PHP][3]:

> Today, PHP is past its prime. According to job search engine Indeed.com, PHP job listings peaked around 2011 and have since plummeted nationally.&nbsp;PHP is especially confusing because of its awkward start. While Python and Ruby began as functional languages from the start, PHP was originally designed to automate the building of HTML templates, and grew into a functional language later. As it added functionality, it picked up a lot of what Moor called its &#8220;quirks and oddities.&#8221;

From 2005 to 2010, I was a full-blown LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) developer. In those days, it was *the* profession to have; we all knew the deficiencies and oddities of PHP, but the industry was booming. We figured that since it had lingered this far, it had eclipsed any sort of obsolescence.

It seems we were wrong.

It&#8217;s interesting to look the well-curated communities devoted to exposing the peculiarities of PHP (such as [PHP Sadness][4], [PHP turtles][5], and [PHPWTF][6]). The passion with which the webdev community has documented PHP&#8217;s shortcomings tells me all I need to know: PHP is dying.

Farewell, old friend. You were crazy, to be sure, but I learned a lot because of you. I&#8217;ll remember you always.
