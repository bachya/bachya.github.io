Marco Arment on whether future Swift developers will need to have a solid grasp of Objective-C:

> I agree with Aaron Hillegass, but only short-term. If you want to develop for iOS in the next year or two, you should probably know Objective-C. But in a few years, I don’t think it’ll matter if you only learn Swift.

Later on:

> The time will come when knowing Objective-C will be like knowing C, C++, or assembly — it’ll be a plumbing layer beneath your application code that almost all working developers will never need to know or interact with. And I bet that time is less than five years away — possibly just two or three.

I&#8217;m not sold on this. The truth is that, only a few weeks removed from WWDC, we don&#8217;t know all that much about Apple&#8217;s new programming language. Craig Federighi boasted of huge performance gains, but we&#8217;ve yet to see those in practice (or whether the compiler optimizations needed for such speed increases will be safe in real world applications).

Right now, the *only* reason Swift could supplant Objective-C&#8217;s necessity is Apple&#8217;s backing power.[^1] That&#8217;s it. Apple wants the world to begin developing Swift-based apps; therefore, it will inevitably happen, regardless of whether the paradigm shift is correct. In time, Swift may emerge as a finely tuned machine, but let&#8217;s be clear: that day isn&#8217;t today (and it may not come for some time). Therefore, Objective-C isn&#8217;t going anywhere anytime soon.

I hope I&#8217;m wrong. There&#8217;s a lot to dislike about the bulkiness of Objective-C (especially in Apple&#8217;s context); I want Swift to be a better option (in fact, *such* a &#8220;better option&#8221; that Objective-C recedes into the background). Only time will tell if it has that ability.

[^1]: There&#8217;s no <em>real</em> reason for this, but I&#8217;m skeptical of a closed-source, closed-environment programming language. Yes, Objective-C was Apple&#8217;s pet for the past decade, but they didn&#8217;t invent the language. I truly have to wonder: what&#8217;s the staying power of a brand-new language created for a closed purpose in an environment that isn&#8217;t friendly to outsiders?&#160;
