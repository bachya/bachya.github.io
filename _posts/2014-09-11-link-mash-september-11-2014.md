*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

  * **<a title="The LastPass Blog: Introducing LastPass for iOS 8." href="http://blog.lastpass.com/2014/09/introducing-lastpass-for-ios-8.html" target="_blank">The LastPass Blog: Introducing LastPass for iOS 8.</a>** Extraordinarily exciting news from LastPass. It seemed obvious that once 1Password did this, LastPass would follow shortly behind, but it&#8217;s still something to see it in writing.
  * **<a title="Asepsis: a system utility for prevention of .DS_Store files" href="http://asepsis.binaryage.com/" target="_blank">Asepsis: a system utility for prevention of .DS_Store files</a>.** &#8216;Nuff said.
  * **<a title="textract" href="http://textract.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">textract</a>.** A wonderful Python &#8220;wrapper&#8221; package that allows for text extraction from a variety of document formats. Via <a href="http://stiglerdiet.com/blog/2014/Sep/10/sundry-links-for-September-10-2014/" target="_blank">Tim Hopper</a>.
  * **<a title="Add OmniFocus Tasks from Linux" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/n8henrie/~3/ZQV8GIYjiqY/" target="_blank">Add OmniFocus Tasks from Linux</a>.** It&#8217;s only in its infancy, but keep an eye on this great project. Its goal: to make it easier to add tasks to OmniFocus from a Linux machine.
