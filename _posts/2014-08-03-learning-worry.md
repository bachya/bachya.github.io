I may not look it to the people who know me, but I am a grade A worrier. Despite my daily work, I have the capacity to worry about nearly *everything*.

I realize that when people say they are worriers, they often stop short of explaining why. My ongoing goal is to be honest with you, so here are the things I worry about:

  * I worry that if I don&#8217;t check in with people I love on a regular basis, they will start to lose their love for me.
  * I worry that when I decline invitations to go do something (because I&#8217;m tired, because I&#8217;m burnt out, etc.), I lose a chunk of the relationship I had with the person I declined.
  * I worry that when I don&#8217;t have the strength to give 100% on any particular day, others will lose their respect for me.
  * I worry that I am selfish in my expectations for what my relationships should look like.
  * Whenever I have a difficult moment in a relationship (and act in a way unbecoming of me), I worry that will be the last conversation I have with that person.
  * I worry that in trying to practice my greatest wish – to be Christ to the world – my shortcomings, mistakes, and poor choices make it so I leave no lasting impact on the lives I care about.

On and on it goes. Very few days go by where I don&#8217;t think about at least one of these (or the myriad others not mentioned here). Some days, it&#8217;s easy to give up the worrying to God; I am able to say, &#8220;Please take this from me&#8221; and He does – it bleeds away. Other days are harder; despite continued requests, the worrying sits on my chest like a boulder.<!--more-->

## TL;DR

God helped me realize today that there are some basic steps to deal with my worries.

## The Story

The heavy days are, as you would imagine, the hardest ones. They have the capacity to sink my mood, put my head in a fog, and leave me thinking, *&#8220;Why do I bother?&#8221;*<sup id="fnref-1737-1"><a href="#fn-1737-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> When I think about those days, I don&#8217;t know which I fear most: that I&#8217;m able to bury and hide it, or that others can plainly see that I&#8217;m struggling.

Today was one of those days. Horribly, I couldn&#8217;t even pinpoint *why* I was letting worry weigh me down; but it surely did. It hurt. It darkened an otherwise fine day.

So I began to pray.

## Halt

Interestingly, I didn&#8217;t pray for relief; I should have – I wanted to – but those words didn&#8217;t come out of my mouth. Something else came out: *&#8220;Why?&#8221; *I wanted to know why I was struggling (especially given that nothing had brought it on). I craved understanding more than anything.

I came to realize a single word had repeated in my head without me knowing it (the same way a song can just appear in my mind and stay there for hours). Again and again, I heard my voice: *halt*. I didn&#8217;t get it; *what is that supposed to mean?* I thought. But there wasn&#8217;t anything else; just that one word, over and over: *halt*.

Suddenly, I remembered an old &#8220;definition&#8221; that I had heard long ago:

**H**(ungry) **A**(ngry) **L**(onely) **T**(ired)

&#8220;HALT&#8221; was the thing to remember when hard feelings came on; it was the circumstances to be aware of when temptation came along; in all things, &#8220;HALT&#8221; represented four practical emotions and &#8220;states of being&#8221; to be aware of.

As it kept repeating, I suddenly remembered that I hadn&#8217;t eaten much today.<sup id="fnref-1737-2"><a href="#fn-1737-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>

Once I took the time to eat a meal, the sad feelings slowly faded away. It wasn&#8217;t long until they disappeared completely.

## The Basics

I realize that this sounds blindingly obvious. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, I became really good at diagnosing difficult spiritual issues and lost my ability to see the basics. Therein lies my struggle: sometimes, those basics are so foreign to me that their absence overtakes my life.

In taking some time to think about it, I realize that God taught me an important lesson today: although there certainly are times where something more monstrous is attacking my life<sup id="fnref-1737-3"><a href="#fn-1737-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, there are also times where remembering the basics is all I need.<sup id="fnref-1737-4"><a href="#fn-1737-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>

Here&#8217;s what it means to me.

### Remember to eat right and get enough sleep.

My &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m tired&#8221; mechanisms don&#8217;t seem to work like they should. In most cases, hunger equates to grumbling stomachs and tiredness equates to a &#8220;I should go to sleep&#8221; realization. Not for me. For me, they lead to feelings of fear, sadness, worry, and a general sense of doom-and-gloom. I somehow translate physical feelings into emotional worries without blinking an eye.

So, my response needs to become more automatic: if I begin to worry about anything, I shelve it until I have a chance to eat and get some sleep. If, after all that, I still feel the heaviness, then I will allow myself to re-examine it.

### Don&#8217;t let one thing bleed into another.

I do this all the time. If work is difficult, I start to wonder if I&#8217;m not a great husband, either. <a title="Flying high: Seahawks dominate Broncos in SB XLVIII rout" href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=340202007" target="_blank">If my team loses the Superbowl</a>, I&#8217;m prone to feeling depressed about other things.<sup id="fnref-1737-5"><a href="#fn-1737-5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> In so many subtle ways, I allow frustrations in one area become frustrations in another.

That outcome, too, has to be a conscious decision. When I pray about my original frustration, I want it to come with an addendum: &#8220;Please help me to not spread this elsewhere.&#8221;

### Let each day be enough.

I pride myself on being a very good &#8220;here-and-now thinker.&#8221; I don&#8217;t often obsess over the past or fixate on what *might* happen in the future; I like the here-and-now. But like anyone, I&#8217;m not perfect, and the days where I allow myself to get embroiled somewhere else in time become incredibly hard.

Jesus was clear about this: &#8220;*Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.&#8221;* (Matthew 6:34 ESV)

There are plenty of times where I know this to be true, but cannot feel it. Those moments, then, are ripe for prayer to remember the moment.

### Give others the benefit of the doubt.

I can&#8217;t count the several times I&#8217;ve allowed my brain to get carried away into a non-existent reality. All too often, I meet a very strange phenomenon: my brain, digging through various thoughts, will start to play an argument between me and someone I love. It seems harmless enough in the beginning, so I let it go and let my mind wander. Before I know it, I, myself, am engaged in that argument. And in the end, something heavy weighs me down (as if the argument had actually happened).

Sometimes, my day starts out with one of these &#8220;head-arguments.&#8221; When I see that person in life, my heart hurts; for all it knows, we argued and are at odds with one another.

I&#8217;ve also gone the other direction: as I mentioned before, I often imagine that others&#8217; love for me wanes when I decline their invitations, don&#8217;t stay in perfectly regular contact, etc. I go ahead and assume (read: make real) that they will be disappointed in me. Before I know it, I&#8217;ve convinced myself that it&#8217;s all real, and that I *should *feel sad about it.

The truly scary part: it isn&#8217;t real. Only the pain I cause my heart is real. In doing this, I lay a heavy burden on myself and put injustice on the person who unwittingly participated in the head-argument.

So, there, too, is a conscious decision: take every thought captive.<sup id="fnref-1737-6"><a href="#fn-1737-6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> When those things pop into my head, I have to declare the truth: that both parties in that head-argument deserve the benefit of the doubt.

## The Road Ahead

My intellectual self reads this and goes, &#8220;Wow, you think about this stuff *way too much*.&#8221; It&#8217;s probably true. That said, these &#8220;simple things&#8221; have, more times than not, led me down a sad, beleaguered path that I&#8217;m tired of walking down. I&#8217;ve been bamboozled into thinking that they are too immense for me to address, and it&#8217;s time for that to stop.

My new mission has to be that every day, I apply dedication, focus, and obedience to what God says is true: in addition to the heavier things of this world, there are some basics that, followed correctly, will spare a lot of pain.

*Thank you for showing me this, Father. I walk forward, a little lighter. Tomorrow will be my first steps back toward the basics. Thank you for lovingly guiding me back there.*

  It&#8217;s interesting that this summer, my small group is studying through the book of Ecclesiastes, which deals with mankind&#8217;s search for what actually has meaning.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1737-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
