[Nathan Sobo][1] at GitHub on [moving Atom to Facebook&#8217;s React library for better performance][2]:

> Performance is a top priority for the Atom team, and recently we’ve been focusing on making basic text editing smoother and more responsive. After some initial incremental progress, we decided to take a step back and rewrite the editor component&#8217;s view layer with a superior framework and a better understanding of the problem.

This is great news; Atom&#8217;s text editing performance (and its **slowness**) was something that kept me from enjoying it.

As a P.S., it&#8217;s fun to see the logic – and passion – that went into this. Watching good developers at their craft is hard to beat.
