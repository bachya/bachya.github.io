Khol Vinh of [Subtraction.com][1] on [Google&#8217;s new design practices and what it means for the company][2]:

> Google’s transition from a company that used to think about design the same way as it thought about human resources—as a cost of doing business—to a company that prioritizes design is remarkable, at least insofar as its products look and feel and work so much better today than they used to. The company is writing a fascinating case study for how to reverse engineer design into a tech giant’s DNA.

I could not agree more. Google&#8217;s powerful push on &#8220;design competence&#8221; is especially amazing given that their chief rival, Apple, has been a design-first company since the beginning.
