Today on the <a title="MailDeck Blog" href="http://maildeckapp.com/blog/" target="_blank">MailDeck blog</a>, I wrote about <a title="Software Is Hard: What It Takes" href="http://maildeckapp.com/2014/07/software_what_it_takes/" target="_blank">why software development is hard (and what you can do to help)</a>.

Having gotten to know Jack Freeman (CTO of Crono, the makers of MailDeck), my stance in the post is stronger than ever. Independent developers work their tails off (often for very little recognition); at the same time, the software-consuming culture of today&#8217;s world has incredibly little respect for those efforts.

I recently saw the following review for a very well known iOS game:

> Game is to short (minus 2 star) Gameis far too
> expensive and my job is too hard to spend my
> money on thís (minus 2 stars). 1 star

Helpful, right? Comments like this are (a) useless and (b) artificially deflate an app&#8217;s overall score without any tactile evidence. Reading this one reinvigorated my beliefs: we all owe it to developers to not be flippant with their work.
