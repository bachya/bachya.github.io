How many times have you used separate web applications and thought, &#8220;This is great, but it would be so much better if I could tie these guys together&#8221;?

Enjoying automation naturally leads to wanting apps to speak each other&#8217;s language. I run into this wish every single day. Fortunately, there is a cure: <a title="IFTTT" href="http://ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> (which stands for &#8220;If This, Then That&#8221;). IFTTT&#8217;s purpose is simple: create connections between applications.<!--more-->

## TL;DR

IFTTT is a great web application and is worthy of your time.

## What IFTTT Does<figure class="thumbnail wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 730px">

IFTTT utilizes up of several components:

  * **Channels:** a Channel is a web application that has triggers and actions. IFTTT has <a title="IFTTT Channels" href="http://ifttt.com/channels" target="_blank">an enormous amount channels</a> (and is adding more every week).
  * **Triggers: **a Trigger is an web-service notification that IFTTT monitors – it is the **This** part of &#8220;If This, Then That&#8221;. Some examples:
      * &#8220;When you take a new photo in Instagram&#8221;
      * &#8220;When I share a link in Evernote&#8221;
      * &#8220;When a new entry appears in an RSS feed&#8221;.
  * **Actions:** an Action is a web-service operation that occurs when a trigger fires – it is the **That** part of &#8220;If This, Then That&#8221;. Some examples:
      * &#8220;Create a status message in Facebook&#8221;
      * &#8220;Create a new Google Doc&#8221;
      * &#8220;Add a new file to Dropbox from a URL&#8221;.
  * **Ingredients:** Ingredients are chunks of data that come from a Trigger that can be given to an Action. Some examples:
      * The text from a Facebook status update
      * The URL of a Tweet
      * The title of a Microsoft OneNote document
  * **Recipes:** a Recipe is a completed set of a Trigger, an Action, and Ingredients.

## My Recipes

Over the past few years, I have built up a collection of great IFTTT Recipes; allow me to share them.

### When my Facebook profile picture changes, change my Twitter profile picture.

I love this one because it saves me time: when I update my Facebook profile picture, update my Twitter profile picture, too.

<a id="embed_recipe-201718" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_76" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/201718-when-my-facebook-profile-picture-changes-change-my-twitter-profile-picture" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/201718" alt="IFTTT Recipe: When my Facebook profile picture changes, change my Twitter profile picture. connects facebook to twitter" width="370px" /></a>

### Invite my new iPhone contacts to connect on LinkedIn.

This might be a bit overzealous, but when I add a new contact to my iPhone, I like to invite that person to connect on LinkedIn.

<a id="embed_recipe-123313" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_52" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/123313-invite-my-new-iphone-contacts-to-connect-on-linkedin" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/123313" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Invite my new iPhone contacts to connect on LinkedIn connects ios-contacts to linkedin" width="370px" /></a>

### If I tag an article with &#8220;Evernote&#8221; in Feedly, then create a note in Evernote.

With all love toward the <a title="Feedly" href="http://feedly.com" target="_blank">Feedly</a> folks, I don&#8217;t feel like paying for Feedly Pro&#8217;s Evernote integration. This recipe shortcuts this process: when I tag an article with the &#8220;Evernote&#8221; tag, it gets sent to Evernote.

<a id="embed_recipe-201719" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_78" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/201719-if-i-tag-an-article-with-evernote-in-feedly-then-create-a-note-in-evernote" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/201719" alt="IFTTT Recipe: If I tag an article with 'Evernote' in Feedly, then create a note in Evernote. connects feedly to evernote" width="370px" /></a>

### If any new Feedly article is saved for later, then add it to Readability.

Once more, with all due deference to Feedly Pro, I don&#8217;t want to pay to send articles to Readability.

<a id="embed_recipe-201720" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_73" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/201720-if-any-new-feedly-article-is-saved-for-later-then-add-it-to-readability" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/201720" alt="IFTTT Recipe: If any new Feedly article is saved for later, then add it to Readability. connects feedly to readability" width="370px" /></a>

### Send iOS notification for new IFTTT channels.

I love IFTTT and want to be notified of its every movement.

<a id="embed_recipe-158584" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_44" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/158584-send-ios-notification-for-new-ifttt-channels" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/158584" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Send iOS notification for new IFTTT channels connects ifttt to ios-notifications" width="370px" /></a>

### Bookmark favorite tweets.

When I mark a tweet as a favorite, save the first link it references to my Pinboard account.

<a id="embed_recipe-121144" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_24" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/121144-bookmark-favorite-tweets" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/121144" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Bookmark favorite tweets connects twitter to pinboard" width="370px" /></a>

### Upload new Instagram photos to Flickr.

When I mark a tweet as a favorite, save the first link it references to my Pinboard account.

<a id="embed_recipe-392" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_37" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/392-upload-new-instagram-photos-to-flickr" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/392" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Upload new Instagram photos to Flickr connects instagram to flickr" width="370px" /></a>
