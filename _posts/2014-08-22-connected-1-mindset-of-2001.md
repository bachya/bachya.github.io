I just listened to the first episode of <a title="Connected" href="http://relay.fm/connected" target="_blank">Connected</a>, the new Apple-based tech podcast from <a title="Relay FM" href="http://relay.fm/" target="_blank">Relay FM</a>Â and the continuation of tech talk goodness from <a title="Myke Hurley on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/imyke" target="_blank">Myke Hurley</a>, <a title="Stephen Hackett on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/ismh" target="_blank">Stephen Hackett</a>, and <a title="Federico Viticci on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/viticci" target="_blank">Federico Viticci</a>. This particular episode is all about the history of the iPod; what an amazing history it&#8217;s been.

What really stood out to me is how I, myself, have progressed. My first generation iPod was my most treasure possession in college; now, after experiencing the comprehensive model of the iPhone, I can&#8217;t imagine carrying any sort of dedicated music/media player.
