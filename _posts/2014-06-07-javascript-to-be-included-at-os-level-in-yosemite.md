<a title="MacStories" href="http://www.macstories.net" target="_blank">Federico Viticci</a> on Apple&#8217;s decision to include JavaScript as an OS-level scripting and automation language:

> This is an interesting change for automation on OS X going forward, and JavaScript will be available alongside AppleScript in the Script Editor.

I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about this decision. Selfishly, a part of me isÂ excited that a more robust programming language (sorry, Applescript) is being included (and in a sponsored fashion) at Yosemite&#8217;s OS level. However, another part is currently thinking, *If Apple does this, we&#8217;re heading further down the rabbit hole into a world where JavaScript is never challenged by a better option.*
