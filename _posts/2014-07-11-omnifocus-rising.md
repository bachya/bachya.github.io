At some point, I began to fall out of love with my longtime friend, [Toodledo][1]. I didn&#8217;t want it to happen – he&#8217;d served me faithfully for years – but time and tide revealed my need for more.

The disillusionment came when [Damian Castillo, aka Proximo][2] (a prolific Toodledo user whose [outstanding GTD setup][3] was the basis for my own) [revealed that he was leaving Toodledo behind][4]:

> My decision was based on personal preference and a solid focus to GTD. GTD is very simple and when implemented correctly, it allows you to get things done and be more productive. I was tired of making Toodledo work for GTD and spent way too much time fixing, tweaking, hacking it to do GTD.

I though back to [my guide to todo management][5]; I loved that little held-together-by-spit-and-glue system, but a part of me was starting to agree with Proximo. I, too, was spending too much time mending it, fixing it, improving it, etc.<sup id="fnref-1544-1"><a href="#fn-1544-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

That wasn&#8217;t the only issue. I was growing dissatisfied with the UI of Toodledo (both the web app and the iOS app). Common actions – like adding subtasks – were unnecessarily difficult. Synchronization of my Saved Searches was sporadic. Each tiny issue added to my growing frustration.

And so, I began to look around.<!--more-->

## TL;DR

I&#8217;m leaving Toodledo for OmniFocus; here are the reasons why.

## The Story

I started my journey by following Proximo from Toodledo to [Nirvana][6]. That worked for a little bit – [I was even excited about it][7] – but I didn&#8217;t care for its stagnant development cycle (well into 2014, it still had an old-school iOS 5-esque UI) or [the deafening silence from its developers][8]. My excitement faded within a week and I moved on.

The next app I tried was [Doit.im][9]. It, too, was a great GTD-focused app and worked well for a time. But I didn&#8217;t love it. Something about the experience wasn&#8217;t great. Like Nirvana, it seemed like a long time had passed since its last update. My experience with Doit.im lasted longer than my experience with Nirvana, but in the end, it didn&#8217;t do it for me.<sup id="fnref-1544-2"><a href="#fn-1544-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>

Day after day, I kept Googling for &#8220;GTD apps.&#8221; I spent time each night looking through the App Store&#8217;s Productivity category. I didn&#8217;t find the magic bullet I was looking for.

During these searches, I did notice a name pop up time and time again: [OmniFocus][10].

## The Courtship

I remember hearing about OmniFocus (and the [Omni Group][11]&#8216;s other products, such as [OmniGraffle][12]) all the way back in college.<sup id="fnref-1544-3"><a href="#fn-1544-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> As I started to browse a bit, I was struck by one thought: &#8220;This is a *beautiful* app.&#8221;

![OmniFocus for OS X][13]

In both the iOS and OS X versions of the app, it was clear that the Omni Group had taken great care in designing an experience that was beautiful, pleasing to look at, and a great UI experience.

I deliberated. Did I want to try *yet another* GTD system (and one that, compared to several others I&#8217;d tried, was expensive)? Did I want to effectively lock myself into the Apple ecosystem with my todo management?<sup id="fnref-1544-4"><a href="#fn-1544-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>

Rather rashly, I bought the iOS version and began using it. And in two weeks, I fell in love. It was simple; it was elegant; most of all, it fit GTD concepts without needing much tweaking at all. For the first time in ages, I was able to focus more on my tasks than on the system managing them.

The one piece missing was the desktop component. I wasn&#8217;t my most effective without a desktop companion to OmniFocus. That said, I kept halting myself. The version of OmniFocus that I wanted – the Professional version that had all the mouthwatering features – was $79.99. Yikes.

I deliberated some more. Finally, I bit the bullet, bought it, and didn&#8217;t look back.

In the time since, OmniFocus has become my go-to companion. It isn&#8217;t perfect, but more often than not, it *just works*. It&#8217;s a joy to use. It helps me focus. Most importantly, it doesn&#8217;t get in the way.

Allow me to share my specifics with you. This won&#8217;t be an authoritative post on OmniFocus itself; rather, it will be the story of how I&#8217;ve made it work for me.

## Initial Considerations

  * Much of my OmniFocus setup is reliant on the [Omni Sync Server][14], which, among other things, allows tasks to synchronize nicely between the iOS and OS X versions of the app.
  * I ended up purchasing the Professional Version because of Focus Mode, Custom Perspectives, and Applescript Support. Be aware that the Standard Version does not include these features.
  * A healthy understanding of GTD is necessary to understand this material and is not something I provide here. Googling for &#8220;GTD&#8221; should get you going.

## Projects

Projects in OmniFocus are exactly what they sound like: grouped sets of tasks geared at accomplishing a discreet purpose. Additionally, OmniFocus carries the nice ability to group projects into folders, which allows for more fine-grained tuning.

Here&#8217;s my setup:

  * **Work Folder**
  * **_Next Actions:** a Single Action project that holds my independent work tasks that don&#8217;t have due dates.
  * **_Scheduled:** a Single Action project that holds my independent work tasks that have due dates.
  * **Projects Folder:** contains all of my work projects (and their associated tasks).
  * **Personal Folder**
  * **_Next Actions:** a Single Action project that holds my independent personal tasks that don&#8217;t have due dates.
  * **_Scheduled:** a Single Action project that holds my independent personal tasks that have due dates.
  * **Projects Folder:** contains all of my personal projects (and their associated tasks).

Additionally, I employ two other Single Action projects that conform to GTD principles: **Someday/Maybe** and **Ticklers**.

![My OmniFocus Project List][15]

Notice that I have **_Next Actions** and **_Scheduled** projects for both my work and personal life. I do this for two reasons:

  1. It allows me to separate those tasks that have hard due dates and those that don&#8217;t.
  2. It allows me to split work from personal life – using OmniFocus&#8217; Focus Mode, I can choose what folders I want to focus on.

## Flags

Flags are much like Toodledo&#8217;s stars; as such, I use them in a similar manner: when I flag a task, I&#8217;m saying that I want to tackle it today. Tasks that I flag don&#8217;t generally have due dates; rather, they are pulled from the &#8220;work on them whenever you want to&#8221; pool for today.

## Perspectives

Perspectives in OmniFocus are custom views that allow you to view tasks that fit specific criteria. By default, OmniFocus comes with a set of base Perspectives:

  * **Inbox:** New tasks are created here by default.
  * **Contexts:** Displays all contexts stored within OmniFocus, as well as the tasks that use those Contexts.
  * **Projects:** Displays all projects stored within OmniFocus.
  * **Changed:** Displays all recently changed items (tasks, projects, etc.).
  * **Flagged:** Displays all tasks that have their flag set.
  * **Completed:** Displays all recently completed tasks.
  * **Review:** Displays OmniFocus&#8217; project review, in which users perform their daily review.

In addition to these, I&#8217;ve created several of my own custom perspectives, which are detailed here. Note that the custom icons I use were pulled from the [OmniFocus Perspective Icons repository on GitHub][16].

### Stalled

![OmniFocus Stalled Perspective][17]

This perspective shows any projects that don&#8217;t have any actions assigned to them. This allows me to do a quick mental check – is there more to that project, or should I close it out?

### Waiting

![OmniFocus Waiting Perspective][18]

This perspective makes use of a context called &#8220;Waiting For&#8221; – this allows me to quickly see all tasks that I&#8217;m waiting on a response for.

### Delegated

![OmniFocus Delegated Perspective][19]

Similar to my Waiting perspective, this one gives me a quick view into the tasks that I&#8217;ve delegated to others.

### Candidates

![OmniFocus Candidates Perspective][20]

This perspective shows my available tasks that don&#8217;t have due dates. These are the tasks that are sitting around, ready for me to address them at my leisure. Notice that I have elements under the Focus drop down; in particular, I&#8217;ve excluded any **_Scheduled** tasks because I only want to see those that are available at my leisure.

### Hotlist

![OmniFocus Hotlist Perspective][21]

This is my primary perspective; it allows me to see any tasks due/overdue and any flagged tasks (thus allowing me to get a handle on what I need to be working on today).

## My Flow

With these custom perspectives in place, here is the flow I follow on a regular basis:

  1. **Inbox.** If there are new tasks in my Inbox, I assign a context to them and assign them to a project. This gets them out of the Inbox and into the rest of the system.
  2. **Stalled.** Next, I check this perspective to see if there are any projects that have stalled (i.e., have no actions left). I quickly deal with them, either by adding tasks or closing the project.
  3. **Waiting.** Waiting reminds me of the owned-by-others tasks that I need to keep an eye on. If I need to follow up on any that day, I flag them.
  4. **Delegated.** Next, I check this perspective to see if I need to act on any tasks that I&#8217;ve assigned to others. If I do that day, I flag them.
  5. **Forecast.** I check this perspective to see if any tasks have suddenly become available today (i.e., today is their &#8220;Defer Until&#8221; date). Of those that do become available, I flag the ones I want to work on today.
  6. **Candidates.** This view contains any available tasks that were available before today, but which I did not choose to act on. Same drill: I flag any tasks that I want to work on today.
  7. **Hotlist.** This is the final stop: all the tasks that I&#8217;ve flagged, plus any due/overdue ones appear here. From this list, I get to work.

## Applescript Support

I mentioned in [a previous post][22] that I have a Hazel action that continually scans my nvALT notes for `[ x ]` symbols and adds their contents to OmniFocus. Allow me to share.

{% gist 8346af91723446b8f24b %}

## Moving Forward

OmniFocus has done the job so far. I will continue to revise my flow over time, but for now, I&#8217;m enjoying my return to GTD&#8217;s central tenant of stress free productivity.
