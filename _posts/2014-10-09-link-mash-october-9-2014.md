*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

  * **<a title="Writing Vim Syntax Plugins" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GiantRobotsSmashingIntoOtherGiantRobots/~3/C1J77cphJcE/writing-vim-syntax-plugins" target="_blank">Writing Vim Syntax Plugins</a>.** Not sure I&#8217;ll ever need to do this, but it had been tickling my brain a bit; good starter.
  * **<a title="Trello this with Keyboard Maestro" href="http://rocketink.net/2014/10/trello-this-keyboard-maestro.html" target="_blank">Trello this with Keyboard Maestro</a>.** Great idea.
  * **<a title="Stamplay | Connect. Automate. Invent" href="https://www.stamplay.com/?utm_expid=86132196-4.9hFYOrdUS_mqjLDOcNSY7Q.0" target="_blank">Stamplay | Connect. Automate. Invent</a>.** Very interesting concept: IFTTT for the backend. Not sure I buy it, but if you are tired of building the same webapps over and over, it might be worth a look.
