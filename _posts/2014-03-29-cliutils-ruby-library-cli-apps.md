Lately, I&#8217;ve been on an app-producing streak. I&#8217;ve mostly focused on command-line apps, programs that run in a terminal (because they&#8217;re cool).

Just released today: CLIUtils, a library for dealing with common headaches (pretty output, configuration management, preference collection, and logging) when developing command-line applications.

<a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/bachya/cliutils" title="Open on Github">Open on Github</a>

This library was created to address a set of my own headaches (primarily centered on copying files from project to project), but it could easily be expanded to address other scenarios. As always, I welcome issues and enhancement ideas on the project&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/bachya/cliutils/issues" target="_blank">issues page</a>.

Also check out the <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/bachya/cli-utils/master/frames" target="_blank">documentation</a> for a more in-depth look at how to use it.
