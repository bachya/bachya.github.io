readwrite explains that mobile payments may finally have reached their life&#8217;s end:

> People still carry around their leather wallets because that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve always done: ***They prefer to pay with debit and credit cards because it&#8217;s just as easy as paying with their phones.*** The result is that mobile wallets have not gained critical mind share among the public. Some individuals may use it at their local shop once a day, but it&#8217;s a rare person that actively pays with their smartphone wherever they go. This behavior is not going to change any time soon, which means mobile wallets like Square are going to continue to struggle—at least until a more legitimate, easy-to-use and cost-effective solution comes along.

So many interesting lessons exist here. Saddest of all, I think, is that despite some serious brainpower from both innovative entrepreneurship (see <a title="Square" href="https://squareup.com/" target="_blank">Square</a>, <a title="Coin" href="https://onlycoin.com/" target="_blank">Coin</a>, etc.) and established enterprise (see Google, PayPal, etc.), our society simply is not ready for mobile payments. It&#8217;s frustrating.<sup id="fnref-965-1"><a href="#fn-965-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
