*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

  * **<a title="7 TextExpander Macros to Increase Your Typing Efficiency" href="http://colterreed.com/7-textexpander-macros-to-increase-your-typing-efficiency/" target="_blank">7 TextExpander Macros to Increase Your Typing Efficiency</a>.** I really appreciate the time-sensitive salutations. I&#8217;ve even developed one for my team in India; if I simply type &#8220;;isal&#8221;, it spits out &#8220;Good morning/afternoon/evening&#8221; depending on their timezone.
  * **<a title="deanishe/alfred-workflow · GitHub" href="https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow" target="_blank">deanishe/alfred-workflow · GitHub</a>.** A supremely helpful Python library for building rich Alfred workflows.
  * **<a title="OmniFocus project templates on iOS – SimplicityBliss" href="http://simplicitybliss.com/omnifocus-project-templates-on-ios" target="_blank">OmniFocus project templates on iOS – SimplicityBliss</a>.** Leave it to Sven Fechner to solve a common OmniFocus for iOS problem – creating instances of &#8220;template&#8221; projects – in an intriguing way. I use this for things like packing lists.
