> The problem now with the lack of early coverage is that *early versions of Android are dying*. While something like Windows 1.0 will be around forever—just grab an old computer and install it—Android could be considered the first cloud-based operating system. Many features are heavily reliant on Google’s servers to function. With fewer and fewer people using old versions of Android, those servers are being shut down. And when a cloud-reliant app has its server support shut off, it will never work again—the app crashes and displays a blank screen, or it just refuses to start.

It&#8217;s fascinating to see Android&#8217;s history laid out like this. It&#8217;s also very telling: such a long history only comes with a long chain of progress and in that chain, it&#8217;s easier to retrospectively see Android&#8217;s problems (fragmentation, feature-incomplete builds, etc.) unfold.
