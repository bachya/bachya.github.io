[Ed Christman][1] with [Billboard][2] on [users&#8217; growing preference to stream music over purchasing it][3]:

> While digital streaming revenue growth continues to offset the decline in digital album and track sales, the music industry still has the same problem it has wrestled with for over a decade: physical music&#8217;s decline is outpacing digital&#8217;s growth.

This is interesting to consider. I&#8217;ve long thought that society&#8217;s expectation – that its &#8220;stuff&#8221; be cloud-accessible – and tendency to shun flat files would carry it further toward streaming music, video, etc. I didn&#8217;t consider that streaming&#8217;s increase might be outpaced by the decline of the industry&#8217;s physical media. It might go without saying, but that isn&#8217;t a winning strategy long-term.

That said, perhaps the hipster DJ crowd might ride to the rescue:

> &#8220;With On-Demand streams surpassing 70 billion songs in the first six months of 2014, streaming continues to be an increasingly significant portion of the music industry,&#8221; says David Bakula, SVP Nielsen Entertainment. &#8220;Streaming&#8217;s 42% year-over-year growth and Vinyl LP&#8217;s 40% increase over last year&#8217;s record-setting pace shows interest in buying and consuming music continues to be robust, with two very distinct segments of the industry expanding substantially.&#8221;

Apparently, I need to get into the vinyl business.
