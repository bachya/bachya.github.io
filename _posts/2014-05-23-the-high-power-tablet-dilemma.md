readwrite explains that Microsoft&#8217;s Surface Pro isn&#8217;t aiming to compete with other tablets like the iPad:

> Microsoft wants to recreate the lucrative PC market that made the company billions of dollars by repackaging a PC into tablet clothing and then hammering away at the Surface product line until everybody believes that PCs never really went anywhere, they just got a touchscreen and a cellular connection.

Wow. That sums up the last generation of Microsoft, right there.<sup id="fnref-1125-1"><a href="#fn-1125-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

The article goes on to explain that at a fundamental level, Microsoft&#8217;s insistence on blending tablet and PC is alienating its potential customers:

> People want bigger smartphones and smaller tablets. When they want PCs, they want either affordable laptops or high-powered expensive desktops with large monitors. The market has not yet said, “we want tablets that act like PCs and are priced much higher than the tablets that we would otherwise buy.”

One the one hand, I agree: there&#8217;s something not-quite-right (from a holistically technical level) with having a high-powered tablet/PC combo. If I&#8217;m going to buy a PC, I want it to be the most high-powered desktop rig ever; if I&#8217;m going to buy a tablet, I&#8217;m willing to sacrifice some power for the sake of form factor.

That said, in the time I&#8217;ve spent with the Surface Pro, I&#8217;ve been impressed. I&#8217;ve even considered what life would be like with one (instead of any version of the iPad) and haven&#8217;t been disappointed. It has the clout to be a power-user&#8217;s tablet.<sup id="fnref-1125-2"><a href="#fn-1125-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>

Of course, one man&#8217;s opinion isn&#8217;t going to change a whole market. Despite some praise from users like me, Microsoft might need a new trick up its sleeve to survive in this world.

  And I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s wrong. Microsoft has endured many failed attempts to catch up in various markets (the Zune, anyone?). It makes sense that they would try to put a fresh coat of paint on the market that&#8217;s been their bread and butter.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1125-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

In my own case, the Surface Pro would allow me to have a fairly decent development box on the go. Add in a little <a title="Babun" href="https://github.com/babun/babun" target="_blank">babun</a>, tweak vim a bit, and we&#8217;d be <em>relatively</em> good to go (minus the inevitable strain-on-the-eyes factor).&#160;<a href="#fnref-1125-2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></li>
