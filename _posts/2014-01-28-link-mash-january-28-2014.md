*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

Introducing my regular Link Mash: a collection of curated stories, tools, ideas, and ramblings that I hope you find interesting.

  * **<a href="http://craigeley.com/post/72565974459/sifttter-an-ifttt-to-day-one-logger" target="_blank">Sifttter: An IFTTT to Day One Logger</a>**. I&#8217;ve struggled mightily with journaling over my life; it often starts as a meaningful exercise and quickly morphs into just another todo. Sifttter is a great utility that, I hope, will change that: it uses IFTTT to send various &#8220;activities&#8221; – Foursquare checkins, Facebook/Twitter/Instagram posts, Toodledo tasks, etc. – that I accomplish throughout my day to my Day One journal.
  * <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mobiledia/the-daily-app-tempo-a-sma_b_4428540.html" target="_blank"><strong>Tempo – A Smarter Calendar</strong></a>. I&#8217;ve tried over a dozen calendar apps for iOS. Some of them have nice user interfaces, some of them have decent functionality, but I&#8217;ve struggled to find one that really fits my workflow. Tempo changes that. Some of my favorite features: automatic dial-in for conference calls, associated documents/emails/etc. with calendar invites, and the ability to email/SMS select members of the group.
  * <a href="http://kotaku.com/google-sure-asks-great-video-game-questions-1510692531?utm_content=buffer00e76&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank"><strong>Google Sure Asks Great Video Game Questions</strong></a>. I often downplay the value of using Google as a social research tool: start typing and let your fellow world citizens show you what&#8217;s important to them. Combine that with my love of video games and you get an easy way to waste an hour.
  * <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-classic-bic-pen-now-works-on-your-smartphone-displa-1510693371?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+gizmodo%2Ffull+%28Gizmodo%29" target="_blank"><strong>The Classic Bic Pen Now Works On Your Smartphone Display Too</strong></a>. I&#8217;ve struggled to figure out whether I like an iPad + stylus note-taking system. Sometimes, chicken scratch with a pen is best. Can Bic solve both problems for me?
  * <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/01/google-glass-finally-works-with-prescription-glasses-costs-225-extra/" target="_blank"><strong>Google Glass finally works with prescription glasses, frames cost $225</strong></a>. Like most geeks, I have a I&#8217;m-really-skeptical-but-still-intrigued attitude toward Google Glass. The fact that it now works with prescription lenses is great. The bad part? *&#8220;That&#8217;s $225 on top of the $1,499 Google charges for Glass, bringing the total cost to $1,724.”*
  * <a href="http://gizmodo.com/how-the-colors-got-their-names-1510522700" target="_blank"><strong>How the Colors Got Their Names</strong></a>. I would never have asked, &#8220;How did colors get their names?&#8221; I wish I had. Fascinating read.
  * <a href="http://jasonkincaid.net/2014/01/evernote-the-bug-ridden-elephant" target="_blank"><strong>Evernote, the bug-ridden elephant</strong></a>. Jason Kincaid wrote a really interesting piece about the troubles he sees with Evernote these days; I happen to agree with many of them. The most interesting part? Phil Libin, Evernote&#8217;s CEO, <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2014/01/04/on-software-quality" target="_blank">responded to it</a>.
  * <a href="http://www.popsci.com/article/science/scientific-evidence-walking-while-texting-bad" target="_blank"><strong>Scientific Evidence That Walking While Texting Is Bad</strong></a>. Cool; I suppose I&#8217;ll be that lame guy who texts while sitting on his couch.
  * <a href="http://jezebel.com/how-often-do-you-really-need-to-shower-1510228527/" target="_blank"><strong>How Often Do You Really Need to Shower?</strong></a> I tend to take a lot of showers; it&#8217;s comforting, I think really well in there, and I find it to make me a happier person.
