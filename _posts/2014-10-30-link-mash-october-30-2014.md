*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

  * **<a title="Data Science at the Command Line" href="http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/" target="_blank">Data Science at the Command Line</a>.** Outstanding list of utilities for manipulating data from the command line.
  * **<a title="The LastPass Blog: Open Sourced LastPass Command Line Application Now Available" href="http://blog.lastpass.com/2014/10/open-sourced-lastpass-command-line.html?m=1" target="_blank">The LastPass Blog: Open Sourced LastPass Command Line Application Now Available</a>.** I&#8217;ve needed this for a long time. Nice to see LastPass catering a bit to developer needs.
