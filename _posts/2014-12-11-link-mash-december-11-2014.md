*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

  * **<a title="Variable Handwritting" href="https://i.imgur.com/NWLFPb3.jpg" target="_blank">Variable Handwritting</a>.** SO COOL.
  * **<a title="Getting Started with JavaScript for Automation on Yosemite" href="http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/getting-started-with-javascript-for-automation-on-yosemite/" target="_blank">Getting Started with JavaScript for Automation on Yosemite</a>.** A great into to scripting with JavaScript on Yosemite.
  * **<a title="Artist Recreates Memorable Moments of Final Fantasy VII" href="http://kotaku.com/artist-recreates-memorable-moments-of-final-fantasy-vii-1664077827" target="_blank">Artist Recreates Memorable Moments of Final Fantasy VII</a>.** So cool. Takes me down memory lane.
  * **<a title="GTD in 15 minutes – A Pragmatic Guide to Getting Things Done" href="http://hamberg.no/gtd/" target="_blank">GTD in 15 minutes – A Pragmatic Guide to Getting Things Done</a>.** One of the best, most concise descriptions of GTD that I&#8217;ve seen. Best of all is the opening quote: &#8220;Pretend your brain is a white board. Is it covered with to-do lists and &#8216;DO NOT ERASE&#8217;? Is there space for drawing and combining ideas?&#8221;
