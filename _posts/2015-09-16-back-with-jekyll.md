It's been a little while since I've last posted here. One of the major reasons is that I've decided to ditch Wordpress.

Wordpress has served me well for a long time, but for many months, it became this big, scary behemoth in my life. I needed to return back to the simplicity of just writing for writing's sake. So, I moved my blog to a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based setup. It provides everything I need: cleanliness, simplicity, and the ability to focus on what I started this blog for in the first place.

Back in action, folks. See you again soon.
