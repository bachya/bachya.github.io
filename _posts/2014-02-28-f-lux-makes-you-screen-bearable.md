Like most geeks, I tend to stay on my computer way too late at night. Even though I&#8217;ve read <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/really-using-a-computer-before-bed-can-disrupt-sleep" target="_blank">too</a> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2158035/Constant-Internet-access-causes-sleep-disorders-depression-late-night-users-likely-suffer.html" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/24/depression-late-night-tv-computer_n_1697214.html" target="_blank">studies</a> about computer use at night, I can&#8217;t seem to help myself.

Tonight, my wife turned me onto an app that I&#8217;ve needed for years: <a href="http://justgetflux.com/" target="_blank">f.lux</a>. By the app&#8217;s own description:

> Ever notice how people texting at night have that **eerie blue glow**?
>
> Or wake up ready to write down the Next Great Idea, and get blinded by your computer screen?
>
> During the day, computer screens look good—they&#8217;re designed to **look like the sun**. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be looking at the sun.
>
> f.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer&#8217;s display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.

It&#8217;s an amazingly easy process: simply choose a color scheme and brightness for &#8220;daytime&#8221; and &#8220;at night&#8221; and let the app do the work. As day turns into night, f.lux takes care of it.

Even after just an hour of use, my eyes already feel better – I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m &#8220;looking at the sun.&#8221; I&#8217;ll be curious to see if this improves my sleep habits at night (although, I suppose the cure-all would be to shut this thing off at a reasonable hour&#8230;but that sounds awfully difficult).
