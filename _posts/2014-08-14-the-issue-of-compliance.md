Today on the <a title="MailDeck Blog" href="http://maildeckapp.com/blog/" target="_blank">MailDeck blog</a>, I wrote about <a title="The Issue Of Compliance â€“ Big Data and User Privacy" href="http://maildeckapp.com/2014/08/issue-compliance-big-data-user-privacy/" target="_blank">the dichotomy of giving your data to large services and trusting them to be trustworthy with it</a>.

As I was writing this, I expected my primary emotion to be one of indignation. It happened, but not in the way I expected; rather than being angry at Facebook about its questionable data collection practices, I became frustrated with society (including myself) for giving Facebook so much personal data to play with.

Living online is based on implicit trust, but it is by no means contractual.
