This is a huge black eye for Yahoo, but I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m surprised. Marissa Mayer&#8217;s tenure with the company has failed to produce anything of substantive value (I&#8217;m sorry: <a title="Summly and its teen founder snapped up by Yahoo " href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/summly-and-its-teen-founder-snapped-up-by-yahoo/2013/03/26/88c5916a-960e-11e2-9e23-09dce87f75a1_story.html" target="_blank">paying $30 million for apps with little inherent value</a> and <a title="Marissa Mayer: Yahoos can no longer work from home" href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/25/technology/yahoo-work-from-home/index.html" target="_blank">reigning in a long-existing work-from-home culture</a> fail to inspire much confidence).

In my opinion, Yahoo has failed to be a relevant player for a long time. Yahoo&#8217;s longstanding mission – to be a portal to every app/service one might need – isn&#8217;t useful to today&#8217;s internet culture. To succeed, a tech company must deal with a strange dichotomy: it must give intrinsic value to users, while understanding that users will switch to alternatives at the drop of a hat. Yahoo has failed to offer that intrinsic value and has allowed users to find other, better alternatives to nearly every service that Yahoo offers.

It&#8217;s going to take an unbelievable turnaround for Yahoo to become relevant again; one has to wonder how much time Meyer has left to carry out that goal.
