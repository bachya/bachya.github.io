iOS 8. Oh my.

You already know the news: Apple unveiled iOS 8 today at its WWDC. There are already [several][1] [excellent][2] [perspectives][3] on its new features, so I won&#8217;t rehash that here. Rather, here are the features that I think you should be excited about.

<!--more-->

## Extensions

YES. FINALLY. iOS 8 is providing developers the ability to publish extension interfaces for their apps. What does this mean? In short, app developers can give other apps specific, controlled access to themselves. Imagine your mail client being able to export to Omnifocus or your web browser being able to create an event in Fantastical. #ohman

I predict that when the dust settles, this is going to be the most influential feature of Apple&#8217;s latest mobile OS.

## Custom Keyboards

The iOS keyboard has been really terrible for a really long time. That changes today. In addition to making some (fairly nice) changes to its stock keyboard, iOS 8 allows users to install *custom keyboards.* Hellloooo Swiftkey/Fleksy/etc.

## Continuity

Apple is slowly-but-surely developing better communication between iOS and OS X. iOS 8 (and OS X) introduces Continuity, which, gives some great functionality:

  * Airdrop now works between OS X and iOS.
  * Handoff allows you to begin activities (like writing emails) on your iPhone/iPad and finish them later on your Mac.
  * iOS can now send text messages (not just iMessages) to OS X.
  * iOS can relay calls to OS X, allowing you to make and receive them without needing to pick up your phone (*whoa!*).

## New Notification Center

In the past, the iOS Notification Center was a useful, but limiting addition to iOS. The biggest problem? To respond to a notification, you had to leave your current app and go to the &#8220;reporter&#8221; app. iOS 8 fixes this by allowing users to respond to notifications right from the Notification Center. Sweet, sweet bliss.

Fall 2014 can&#8217;t come soon enough.

***EDIT:*** *The Verge released <a title="8 huge new features in iOS 8 that Apple didn't talk about today" href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/2/5773526/8-new-features-in-ios-8-that-apple-didnt-talk-about-today" target="_blank">a list of 8 huge features that Apple didn&#8217;t specifically call out today</a>. My favorite: battery usage by app.*
