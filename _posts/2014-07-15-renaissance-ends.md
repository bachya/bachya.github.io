> I haven’t launched Xcode since last December. Every time I’m out socially with software developers (which is often; I’ve made many good friends in that line of work, and I have no desire to lose them), at least one person asks me if I miss the job. My mind still works in a systemic, algorithmic way – and it probably always will&#8230;But it never gets as far as launching an IDE&#8230;I go up to a certain point, then I disengage – and it doesn’t even take any willpower.

Truth be told, I&#8217;m somewhat relieved to read this position; it&#8217;s one I&#8217;ve felt recently, too. I spent years as a hardcore developer (primarily on the web). I fixated on new frameworks, worked on huge projects, and poured myself into the code.

I&#8217;m not there anymore, either.

Matt goes on:

> I’m a *tinkerer* now. I don’t launch Xcode, I don’t keep a record of the app ideas I have, and I don’t write code – except that, of course, I still *sort of* do. I automate tasks on my machines, often via shell scripts. I use regular expressions all the time. I write the occasional piece of server-side logic for something in relation to this blog. I extend the productivity utilities I use, for my own benefit.

That sounds about right, too. My most-read posts on this blog are all related to enhancing *other* apps<sup id="fnref-1566-1"><a href="#fn-1566-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref-1566-2"><a href="#fn-1566-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref-1566-3"><a href="#fn-1566-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, and after all this time, *I enjoy that*. I want to be disturbed that I haven&#8217;t produced a fully-fledged piece of software in years, but I&#8217;m just not. The developer world says I&#8217;m languishing on the sidelines, but in my eyes, I&#8217;m enjoying my life more.

That isn&#8217;t the only benefit, however – Matt touches on that, too:

> I’m also glad that I can view the WWDC keynote as a tourist, without any approaching tension headache as I think about what I’ll need to add, or change, or remove. I can drift languidly along on the slow-moving current of the everyday web, indulging an old habit when a rainy evening comes by. It’s a profoundly relaxing thing to be able to observe the technology industry without being invested in it. I’m glad I’m not making software anymore.

Bingo. While catching WWDC and I/O this year, I kept thinking, *Man, I wonder what it&#8217;s going to be like for all those developers out there who need to update their apps&#8230;*

All *those* developers&#8230;I was one of them not long ago, but not anymore. The most freeing part of all? Saying it out loud lifts a huge weight off my chest.

The world of development has changed vastly. More and more developers enter the world every day; more and more often, apps are simply derivatives of already-existing concepts. There is plenty of new blood out there and those folks may be the ones to define a new marketplace.

For me, I&#8217;m going to be okay watching that marketplace unfold from the sidelines.
