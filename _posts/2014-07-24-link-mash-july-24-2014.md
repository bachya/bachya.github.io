*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

  * **<a title="CoRD: Remote Desktop for Mac OS X" href="http://cord.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">CoRD: Remote Desktop for Mac OS X</a>.** The Microsoft Remote Desktop client isn&#8217;t good at all. This is a great alternative with nice additional features.
