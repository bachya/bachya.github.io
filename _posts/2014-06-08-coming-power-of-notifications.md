[Mat Honan][1] on why iOS 8 will usher in the era of notifications as the most important smartphone interaction:

> When we can interact with our data in short bursts via notifications, we make remarkable efficiency gains, especially on tasks that we perform again and again. Apps will become more about information and communications; we’re going to think of them as services instead of as windows onto our data.

It’s true. Android has laid the ground work, but the tightly defined user experience in iOS is going to take this to a whole new level. Smartphone productivity is about to get a whole lot more productive.
