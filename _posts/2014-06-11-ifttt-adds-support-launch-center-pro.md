Exciting news for productivity nerds this morning: web app-connecting powerhouse IFTTT (<a title="How IFTTT Changed My Life" href="http://www.bachyaproductions.com/ifttt-changed-life/" target="_blank">which we&#8217;ve discussed before</a>) and the magical Launch Center Pro (<a title="How I Optimized my iPhone with Launch Center Pro" href="http://www.bachyaproductions.com/how-optimized-iphone-launch-center-pro/" target="_blank">which we&#8217;ve also discussed before</a>) <a title="Introducing the Launch Center Channel" href="http://blog.ifttt.com/post/88480868668/introducing-the-launch-center-channel" target="_blank">just got hitched</a>:

> It’s like speed dial for everyday tasks. Launch Center Pro saves you time by launching complex actions with a single tap.
>
> A little more sophisticated than your average Channel. A lot more powerful.

This announcement coincides with the release of Launch Center Pro 2.3, which includes a bunch of new features:

  * Location Triggers (to accommodate geofencing and iBeacons)
  * IFTTT Integration (of course)
  * Giphy Search
  * QR Code and Barcode Scanning
  * Much more

I could not be more excited. Combining the power of iOS URL Schemes with the litany of channels in IFTTT (some of which don&#8217;t have URL schemes in their native apps) is going to open up a world of possibilities. I&#8217;ll make sure to share any interesting ones I find. <img src="http://www.bachyaproductions.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
