You&#8217;re rolling now, aren&#8217;t you? Emails aren&#8217;t an issue anymore. Tasks and things to do? Under control. You&#8217;re enjoying a more productive (and ultimately, happy) life.

*This is Part 3 in a 3 part series on productivity. [Part 1 covers email management][1] and [Part 2 covers todo management][2].*

There&#8217;s one more stop on our journey, however. For many, this destination is the hardest of all; it requires a powerful shift in one&#8217;s perspective. Adopting this strategy will need even more diligence than you&#8217;ve been asked to display thus far.

This destination is all about archiving. It&#8217;s about clearing the remaining clutter out of your mind, inbox, mailbox, bowl-on-the-kitchen-table, or wherever else you store it and putting it into a reliable system.

If you&#8217;re like me, you have *stuff* everywhere – receipts, old statements, articles you want to save, notes that you love and want to keep (but don&#8217;t want to have to store somewhere), recipes that you want to remember, emails that have a special or important meaning, and a trillion other items. The amount of clutter – physical or digital – is overwhelming; it all seems important, but you have no system for archiving it in a way conducive to retrieval later.

In the spirit of this series – reducing unnecessary burdens on the mind – I want to share my secret sauce for archiving these materials. Through much toil and headache, I&#8217;ve arrived at a system that allows me to store these important materials and easily recall them later.<!--more-->

## TL;DR

Here&#8217;s how I use Evernote: as my material archive.

## Preamble

I&#8217;ve blogged about [Evernote-related topics][3] many times before; it might be the one application I cannot live without. It wasn&#8217;t always this way, however.

As always, allow me to start with the story of how Evernote came into my life.

I started using Evernote in grad school. At the time, I hated taking notes and paper. I needed something better; moreover, I needed something that could synchronize those notes between my old Macbook and my Windows PC. After some diligent Google searching, I found the green elephant.

I must admit: at first, I was not impressed. Perhaps my expectations were too out-there; perhaps I was looking for Evernote to be an all-around assistant, and not just a set of digital notebooks. Whatever the case, Evernote was quickly relegated to the &#8220;I &#8216;should&#8217; like this, so I&#8217;ll keep it around, but never really use it&#8221; bin. It stayed like that for a long time.

Fast forward 3 years. I was knee-deep in my first job and swimming in *stuff*. I was archiving random bits of paper, printed emails, and other *stuff* in various manilla folders (and storing those folders rather haphazardly in my single filing cabinet). The worst came when I traveled; I would inevitably leave important documents back in that filing cabinet. I was forced to try to remember information on the fly. It was awful.

One day, a coworker said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you use Evernote to store all that stuff?&#8221; My mind froze. I was used to thinking of Evernote as &#8220;that tool that sounded neat, but I could never find a use for.&#8221; In that moment, however, I began to see something more; what if Evernote could be my digital filing cabinet? What if Evernote could be that intelligent, virtualized space that held all the *stuff* I needed to get rid of?

What I came up with has served me well to this day. Allow me to share it with you.

I assume that upon reading this, you have a rudimentary understanding of Evernote and its parts. If that isn&#8217;t the case, check out <a title="Evernote Knowledge Base" href="https://evernote.com/contact/support/kb/#!/product/evernote" target="_blank">Evernote&#8217;s Knowledge Base</a> before reading on.

Got it? Let&#8217;s go.

## Getting Stuff Into Evernote

To start, allow me to explain the various methods I use to get items into Evernote:

  * **<a title="Evernote Web Clipper" href="https://evernote.com/webclipper/" target="_blank">Evernote Web Clipper</a>:** a supremely powerful extension that easily brings web pages, PDFs, Gmails, and more into Evernote.
  * **<a title="How to send email into Evernote" href="https://evernote.com/contact/support/kb/#/article/23480523" target="_blank">Via Email</a>:** because every Evernote user gets their own email address, it&#8217;s easy to send emails directly into Evernote.
  * **<a title="Boxer" href="https://appcenter.evernote.com/app/boxer/ipad" target="_blank">Via Boxer</a>:** in Boxer (the email client I use on my iPhone), I can swipe left or right to immediately send an email to Evernote. Simple!
  * **Via <a title="Hazel" href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel" target="_blank">Hazel</a>:** by using Hazel&#8217;s automation rules, I can set up a **Send to Evernote** directory; when any file gets placed in here, it automatically gets added to a new Evernote note (<a title="bachya/Code" href="https://github.com/bachya/Code/tree/master/hazel" target="_blank">check out my Github</a> to see the rules).
  * **Via <a title="Drafts" href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/" target="_blank">Drafts</a>:** many of my actions deal with Evernote notes.

## Notebooks

Some Evernote users like to have a new notebook for every new undertaking and every new project. I don&#8217;t work that way; instead, I keep a limited number of notebooks based on overall context.

My notebooks break into two categories: **Personal** and **Work**.

  * **Personal Notebooks**
      * **Personal Archive:** my all-purpose personal life notebook; most of my non-work-related notes go in here.
      * **Us:** the notebook that I share with my wife; any notes that both need access to go in here.
      * **House Inventory:** a notebook full of pictures of valuable items in our house; we support this for when we ever need inventory info for insurance purposes.
  * **Work Notebooks**
      * **Work Archive:** my all-purpose work notebook; almost all of my work-related notes go in here.
      * **How-To:** a collection of &#8220;how-to&#8221; notes that I share with my colleagues.
      * **Aaron & *:** a series of notebooks that I share with particular people; any notes that we both need access to go in their respective notebook.

That&#8217;s it: 6 total notebooks run my archival needs. In general, I only create a new notebook when I need to share it with someone specific.

&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I can hear you say. &#8220;What about your various work projects? Personal projects? Aren&#8217;t they in need of their own notebook?&#8221;

Negative, dear reader. That&#8217;s where **tags** come into play.

## Tags

Tags are much like labels in Gmail: they attach a label to a particular note in Evernote. And, in the same way that Gmail labels are preferable to more traditional email folders, I find that Evernote tags are preferable to innumerable notebooks.

Here&#8217;s why: pretend you have a single note that details info on three different work projects. Since Evernote notes can only belong to one notebook, you&#8217;re in a pickle; which of your three project notebooks do you stick the note in? Do you (**ugh**) make *copies* of the note and place one in each notebook? (please say no&#8230;)

Tags, however, are different. A single note can have an unlimited number of tags applied to it. Look again at the previous example; what if, regardless of the container notebook, that note could be tagged with tags on all three projects? Suddenly, you have a much more flexible system.

That said, it is possible to go overboard with tags. In general, I try to keep a limited number.

  * **!Locations:** has several sub-tags related to specific physical locations (e.g., **!Home**); when a note relates to that place, I tag it as such.
  * **!People:** has sub-tags related to specific people; when I keep something that relates to a specific person, that tag gets applied.
  * **!Projects:** has sub-tags for each project that I&#8217;m working on; I prefix them to decide whether they are personal or work projects (e.g., **Personal:Sifttter-Redux** or **Work:ABC Company**).

In addition to these larger tag groupings, I keep several common individual tags. Some of my favorites:

  * **cards/notes:** I tend to scan and save cards and notes people have given me; they get tagged with this tag (and, often, the tag from **!People** that relates to the giver).
  * **gift-idea:** gift ideas get tagged for easy retrieval later (again, with the related tag from **!People**).
  * **manual:** gets applied to all my scanned product manuals (a lifesaver, trust me).
  * **product/license-key:** gets applied to any license key that I receive (another lifesaver).
  * **tax:** gets applied to anything tax-related; when March 1st comes around, I merely check this tag and get everything I need.

By applying the right combination of tags, notes become immediately more useful. The digital filing cabinet becomes far more useful than the standard physical one.

## Just The Beginning

By being such an expansive, powerful, open-ended tool, Evernote is infinitely customizable (or nearly so). I have no doubt that in time, my system will change. That said, my current setup allows me to collect all the *stuff* that needs archiving, store it in a centralized place, tag it appropriately, and find it easily later on.
