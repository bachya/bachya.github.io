<a title="Leo Mirani" href="http://qz.com/author/lmiraniqz/" target="_blank">Leo Mirani</a> at Quartz <a title="iOS 8 strikes an unexpected blow against location tracking" href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5792970/ios-8-strikes-an-unexpected-blow-against-location-tracking" target="_blank">describes</a> a relatively unnoticed addition to iOS 8 – MAC address spoofing – that will change the consumer privacy landscape:

> Apple’s solution, as discovered by a Swiss programmer, is for iOS 8, the new operating system for iPhones which will be out later this year, to generate a random MAC addresses while scanning for networks. That means that companies and agencies that collect such information will not necessarily know when the same device (i.e., person) visits a store twice, or that the same device pops up in stores across the country or the world, suggesting a much-travelled owner.

Why is this important? You should probably know by now.

> Whenever you walk around a major Western city with your phone’s Wi-Fi turned on, you are broadcasting your location to government agencies, marketing companies and location analytics firms.

This system, <a title="Russell Brandom" href="http://www.theverge.com/users/russell.brandom" target="_blank">Russell Brandom</a> at The Verge <a title="iOS 8 strikes an unexpected blow against location tracking" href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5792970/ios-8-strikes-an-unexpected-blow-against-location-tracking" target="_blank">explains</a>, is more complex than most consumers realize:

> As The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/15/business/attention-shopper-stores-are-tracking-your-cell.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">reported last summer</a>, shops from Nordstrom&#8217;s to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/23/2582443/two-us-malls-will-track-shoppers-location-via-their-cellphone-this" target="_blank">JC Penney</a> have tried out the system. (London even tried out a system <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/08/no-this-isnt-a-scene-from-minority-report-this-trash-can-is-stalking-you/" target="_blank">using public trash cans</a>.) The system automatically logs any phone within Wi-Fi range, giving stores a complete record of who walked into the shop and when. But any phone using iOS 8 will be invisible to the process, potentially calling the whole system into question.

Apple&#8217;s concrete effort to step out of this arena is pretty shocking, but in a good way. In a post-NSA-awareness world, tech giants who choose to protect privacy (like <a title="Google is encrypting search globally. That’s bad for the NSA and China’s censors." href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/03/12/google-is-encrypting-search-worldwide-thats-bad-for-the-nsa-and-china/" target="_blank">Google</a> and now, Apple) might actually be able to win back some of the trust lost during the last year. The trick, as always, is consistency.
