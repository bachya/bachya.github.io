Over at [MacStories][1], [Federico Viticci][2]&nbsp;posted [his Launch Center Pro setup][3] today:

> Over the past two years, we’ve covered Launch Center Pro, one of my favorite apps for iPhone and iPad, several times here at MacStories. We’ve detailed major updates that were released by Contrast and published a complete guide to go from novice to advanced user; we’ve also focused on the hidden features for power users that the developers recently snuck into a seemingly minor update. And yet, in spite of the coverage, I’ve never really addressed the question that I often receive from MacStories readers – How do you use Launch Center Pro?

There are many&nbsp;LCP&nbsp;blog posts out there – Federico is a master on the subject<sup id="fnref-1494-1"><a href="#fn-1494-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> – but I&#8217;ve yet to see that many posts describing how people use LCP in their day-to-day life (a big reason I wrote [my own &#8220;real-life&#8221; guide][4]). That&#8217;s a hard thing – LCP is not the easiest app to integrate into Average Joe&#8217;s workflow, which creates a need for these types of guides.

Seeing a timely entry from one of the biggest LCP evangelists on the planet should do the trick.
