*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

  * **<a href="http://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>.** I wish more people knew about this app; it&#8217;s completely changed how I manage projects, both professionally and personally. Some of my favorite uses: tracking grocery needs, figuring out Christmas gifts, tracking status on personal projects, and so much more.
  * **<a href="http://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier</a>.** I&#8217;ve talked about IFTTT and my love for it before. I recently stumbled upon Zapier, which boasts similar functionality, but with an *enormous* list of apps. Only downside is that to do heavy lifting with it, you&#8217;ll shell out some cash.
  * **<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5978594/turn-a-raspberry-pi-into-an-airplay-receiver-for-streaming-music-in-your-living-room" target="_blank">Turn a Raspberry Pi Into an AirPlay Receiver for Streaming Music in Your Living Room</a>.** I recently did this and boy, was it worth it. From my wife: &#8220;Babe, AirPi is sooo cool! Thank you so much for making it:)&#8221;
  * **<a href="http://lifehacker.com/the-best-resources-to-learn-to-code-1517844722" target="_blank">The Best Resources to Learn to Code</a>.** I often get asked how I learned to program; unfortunately, would-be enthusiasts don&#8217;t like hearing that I went to college for it. These days, however, resources are limitless and this article highlights a few of my favorites.
  * <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/2014/02/stuff-you-love-mentality/" target="_blank"><strong>What if we only bought the stuff we loved?</strong></a> A part of me often feels like I have to buy the things I want right there and now (otherwise, what&#8217;s the point?) This article is a great reminder about being more discerning about the things we choose to buy.
  * **<a href="http://freakonomics.com/2014/02/05/the-inefficiency-of-long-hours/" target="_blank">The Inefficiency of Long Hours</a>.** It&#8217;s rather arcane for humanity to believe that it needs to work longer and longer to produce results. When it comes to overturning long-held beliefs with data, the Freakonomics guys are the best.
  * **<a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2014/02/06/mac-icon-standard" target="_blank">Mac Icon Standard</a>.** A really neat font that, to use Subtraction&#8217;s words, &#8220;consists of elegant line drawings of every single model of Macintosh ever shipped.&#8221;
