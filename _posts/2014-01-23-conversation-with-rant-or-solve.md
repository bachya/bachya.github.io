Conversations are hard. This is especially true when one person&#8217;s expectations of the conversation don&#8217;t meet the other&#8217;s.

The other day, two of my coworkers introduced me to a neat communication method that they&#8217;ve affectionately titled *Rant or Solve?* It&#8217;s purpose: to establish up front what the expected outcome of a difficult conversation is.

To summarize their thoughts:

> Men and women tend to deal with a &#8220;non-catastrophic&#8221; frustrating conversation differently. Although the roles can be reversed, men tend see a difficult conversation as something to solve, whereas women see that same conversation as something to vent about and move on.

> **Rant or Solve?** is a simple way to verify intention. When one of us has a frustrating &#8220;ughh&#8221; moment, the other will ask, &#8220;Rant or solve?&#8221; Based upon the response, the listener (a) is in a better position to give the talker what they need and (b) can more easily understand the attitude they need to have (saving both of them unnecessary frustration in the conversation).

This was a revelation to me. I often make the mistake of assuming that others&#8217; &#8220;ughh&#8221; moments are problems to solve; If it doesn&#8217;t turn out that way, I get frustrated. *Rant or Solve?* is a clever way to bypass that frustration and give exactly what&#8217;s needed.

I often notice this with my wife. When she has frustrations at work or with various situations, I start to think, &#8220;I need to help her solve this to move forward.&#8221; Often, though, she isn&#8217;t looking for solutions; she merely wants to get the frustration off her chest. When I charge forward to problem solve, I simultaneously rob her of that opportunity and get myself frustrated. *Rant or Solve?* might just give me a way to be more intelligent about those situations.
