> Apple has a lot more going on in iOS 8 besides these changes, but they make it just that much easier for those trying to use mobile devices to encourage sales and commerce activity. It’s still unclear what, if any kind of mobile commerce push Apple will make itself – we’ve heard rumors about iTunes becoming a platform for much broader types of payments for a while now – but in the meantime, it’s clear it still wants to be the best mobile platform for those looking to drive pay-based engagement.

I&#8217;m intrigued to see what Apple does here. We&#8217;ve already discussed the idea that <a title="→ The Death of Mobile Payments" href="http://readwrite.com/2014/05/13/mobile-wallets-reality" target="_blank">our society isn&#8217;t ready for a lifestyle of mobile payments</a>, but what if one of the most valuable companies on the planet (a) removes friction from the experience and (b) convinces its customers that they *have* to be a part of the experience.

Since last week, something has become increasingly clear: iOS 7 wasn&#8217;t the flop that everyone thought it was; it merely laid the groundwork for iOS 8. This could be a similar scenario: might we look back at iOS 8 and see the foundation for a revolution in mobile commerce?
