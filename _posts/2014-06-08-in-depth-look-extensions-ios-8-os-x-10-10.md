<a title="Andrew Cunningham" href="http://arstechnica.com/author/andrew_cunningham/" target="_blank">Andrew Cunningham</a> at Ars Technica has <a title=" Explaining iOS 8’s extensions: Opening the platform while keeping it secure" href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/06/explaining-ios-8s-extensions-opening-the-platform-while-keeping-it-secure/" target="_blank">a great, in-depth writeup on how extensions will work in iOS 8</a>:

> Like all third-party apps on a non-jailbroken iPhone, all iOS extensions are downloaded from the App Store. The biggest limitation here is that Apple won&#8217;t allow developers to offer apps that are *just*extensions. Each extension has to live within a &#8220;containing app,&#8221; and Apple mandates that the containing app must offer some functionality to the user. Unlike in Android, developers cannot offer apps that are *just *widgets or *just* keyboards (this applies only to iOS; OS X developers can offer apps that are simply wrappers for extensions).

Apple has long been hesitant to let apps talk with each other because of security. It makes sense that in finally offering that type of communication, iOS would be forced to adhere to some strict rules.

This does answer a question I had: *Would it be possible for me to develop extensions for other apps (not owned by me)?* I guess a man can dream.
