Back in the day, I was obsessed with <a title="Launchy" href="http://www.launchy.net/" target="_blank">Launchy</a>, a small utility that acted as an application launcher/script runner/multi-purpose tool on Windows. It felt so cool to have a quick assistant that responded intelligently to my commands.

When I first moved to OS X in 2007, I found my replacement for Launchy: OS X&#8217;s built-in Spotlight. It seemed to do the trick: I could launch apps, find files, do math&#8230;fine and dandy. Over time (and by that, I mean 6 years of time), I fell out of love with Spotlight. It just didn&#8217;t have the pizzaz I was looking for.

At some point in that 6 year stretch, I stumbled across <a title="Quicksilver" href="http://qsapp.com/" target="_blank">Quicksilver</a>, a Launchy equivalent on OS X. To be truthful, I didn&#8217;t like it. It seemed clunky, like something that had been popular in a bygone era, but was now showing its age (much like Launchy itself). Nope.

And then I found <a title="Alfred 2" href="http://www.alfredapp.com" target="_blank">Alfred 2</a>. And much like Alfred Pennyworth<sup id="fnref-866-1"><a href="#fn-866-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, I loved him. Allow me to share why I love him so much.<!--more-->

## TL;DR

I&#8217;ve *finally* started to get into Alfred 2; I&#8217;m also wondering how I lived without it for so long.

## The Setup

By itself, Alfred is very powerful. However, its true power is hidden it its <a title="Alfred Powerpack" href="http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/" target="_blank">Powerpack,</a> a great set of tools and extensions that are absolutely worth the $30 price tag. Most crucial for me among the Powerpack&#8217;s features are workflows:

> <span style="color: #666666;">Create immensely powerful workflows by connecting keywords, hotkeys and actions together to extend Alfred to do amazing things without writing a single line of code!</span>

If that doesn&#8217;t sound like a productivity nerd&#8217;s best friend, I don&#8217;t know what does.

## Workflows

Here are the 15 workflows that boost my productivity and make a better citizen of humanity.

### [Alfred for Trello](https://github.com/MikoMagni/Alfred-for-Trello)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-873" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.05.28-PM.png" alt="Alfred for Trello" width="648" height="178" />

I&#8217;ve mentioned <a title="Link Mash (February 11, 2014)" href="http://www.bachyaproductions.com/link-mash-february-11-2014/" target="_blank">my love for Trello</a>. This workflow allows me to quickly add cards to my &#8220;INBOX&#8221; board: when I want to jot an idea into Trello, this gets the job done.

###  [Colors](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/805-colors%E2%80%94convert-color-formats-access-the-os-x-color-panel/)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-876" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.09.42-PM.png" alt="Colors for Alfred" width="648" height="295" />

My job constantly demands that I translate between color formats (RGB, Hex, etc.). This workflow allows me to quickly figure these values out and send them to other apps, workflows, etc.

### [**Doit.im**](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/3844-add-tasks-to-doitim/)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-877" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.11.22-PM.png" alt="Doit.im for Alfred" width="648" height="178" />

Doit.im has become new favorite task manager. Its OS X app allows for quick entry of tasks, but when I&#8217;m immersed in Alfred-ness<sup id="fnref-866-2"><a href="#fn-866-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, it&#8217;s often easier to just add the task here.

### [Encode/Decode](https://github.com/willfarrell/alfred-encode-decode-workflow)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-878" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.14.31-PM.png" alt="Encode/Decode for Alfred" width="648" height="256" />

Like color translation, my job also features a lot of URL and HTML encoding. To date, I&#8217;ve used <a title="URL Decoder/Encoder" href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/" target="_blank">Eric Meyer&#8217;s timeless URL Decoder/Encoder</a>, but I realize now that&#8217;s too many steps. This workflow gives me the power I need.

### [Evernote](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/840-evernote-86-search-create-append-preview-set-reminders-all-within-alfred/)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-882" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.18.21-PM.png" alt="Evernote for Alfred" width="648" height="490" />

(look at that enormous list of actions!)

You know what else takes too many steps? Switching to Evernote and doing something.<sup id="fnref-866-3"><a href="#fn-866-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> This workflow allows me to create/update notes, search for notes, and reminders, and much more.

### [Fantastical](http://tedwi.se/u/ed)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-883" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.21.16-PM.png" alt="Fantastical for Alfred" width="648" height="178" />

I already use <a title="Fantastical for iOS" href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone" target="_blank">Fantastical on iOS</a> and [Fantastical on OS X][1]; its natural language  parsing abilities are awesome. This workflow allows me to hook into the OS X app and easily add events.

### [GitHub](https://github.com/gharlan/alfred-github-workflow)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-884" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.28.24-PM.png" alt="GitHub for Alfred" width="648" height="217" />

Despite <a title="GitHub Tries Again At Transparency" href="http://readwrite.com/2014/04/28/github-investigation-wanstrath-horvath-preston-werner-discrimination-transparency" target="_blank">the bad stuff that&#8217;s come out of it lately</a>, I still rely heavily on GitHub for all my projects. This workflow allows me to search for repos, work with them, and so much more.

### [IP Address](http://zno.io/RcAi)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-885" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.30.07-PM.png" alt="IP Address for Alfred" width="648" height="256" />

How often have you wanted to look up your IP address (local or external)? &#8216;Nuff said.

### [Kill Process](http://zno.io/RcNL)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.31.46-PM.png" alt="Kill Process for Alfred" width="648" height="490" />

When a process hangs, it&#8217;s a hassle to open Activity Monitor, search for it, and kill it. Once again, Alfred makes a repetitive task much faster.

### [Open With Atom](https://github.com/franzheidl/alfred-workflows/raw/master/open-with-atom/Open%20with%20Atom.alfredworkflow)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-887" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.33.45-PM.png" alt="Open Atom for Alfred" width="648" height="178" />

<a title="Link Mash (May 1, 2014)" href="http://www.bachyaproductions.com/link-mash-may-1-2014/" target="_blank">I recently started playing with Atom as my full-time editor</a>; this workflow is a bit simple, but it allows me to quickly open files and begin editing.

### [Shorten URL](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/935-workflowshorten-url-support-googl-bitly-tcn-jmp-isgd-vgd/)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-889" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.36.52-PM.png" alt="Shorten URL for Alfred" width="648" height="412" />

Shortening URLs (for tweets, emails, etc.) is a pain; you have to go to the website you want, enter your URL, wait for the transformation to occur, copy it, and move on. This allows for a quicker process across all the famous URL shorteners.

### [StackOverflow](http://zno.io/RceO)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-890" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.38.48-PM.png" alt="StackOverflow for Alfred" width="648" height="490" />

I look at <a title="StackOverflow" href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> *constantly*; this workflow means I don&#8217;t have to manually open a browser, go there, and search the question.

### [TomatoTomato](https://github.com/nbcmayhem/alfred-workflow-tomatotomato/archive/master.zip)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-892" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.41.20-PM.png" alt="TomatoTomato for Alfred" width="648" height="178" />

I probably shouldn&#8217;t, but I rely on Rotten Tomatoes to tell me whether a movie is worth my time. This quick workflow allows me to see the scores quickly.

(And I can confirm: <a title="Captain America: The Winter Soldier on IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/" target="_blank">The Winter Soldier</a> is worth seeing.)

### [Weather](http://dferg.us/weather-for-alfred-2/)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-893" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.43.19-PM.png" alt="Weather for Alfred" width="648" height="295" />

My wife asks me at least once a day what the weather will be like tomorrow. Alfred to the rescue.

### [Workflow Searcher](https://github.com/hzlzh/Alfred-Workflows/raw/master/Downloads/Workflow-Searcher.alfredworkflow)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-894" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.45.18-PM.png" alt="Workflow Searcher for Alfred" width="648" height="256" />

Since all my other workflows eschew the need to open a browser, why wouldn&#8217;t I have a workflow to search for workflows?<sup id="fnref-866-4"><a href="#fn-866-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>

## Other Cool Tidbits

Alfred can do so much more; here are some other nifty tricks for your consideration.

### Clipboard History

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-896" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.47.06-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-05-02 at 7.47.06 PM" width="648" height="431" />

I used to use <a title="ClipMenu" href="http://www.clipmenu.com/" target="_blank">ClipMenu</a> for clipboard management on my Mac; although it did a swell job, I decided to remove it in favor of Alfred&#8217;s (which works equally well and saves me an extra app).

### Locking Your Mac

Being in an office environment, I like to exercise caution by locking my Mac when I walk away. Surprisingly, OS X makes this really difficult to do in a quick way; Alfred solves that problem with the `lock` command.

### Copying Contact Details

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-899" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-02-at-7.52.04-PM.png" alt="Contact Management in Alfred" width="648" height="178" />

It might seem like a simple thing, but Alfred has some great contact management abilities. My favorite: quickly copy a contact&#8217;s email address, phone number, or other attributes with a keystroke.

## What Else?

The possibilities with Alfred are limitless. What have you come up with to make your life more productive?
