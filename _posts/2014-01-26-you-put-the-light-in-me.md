For me, Sunday morning is a time of reflection. Life is such a whirlwind lately – progressing deeper and deeper into marriage, striving to build real, full-of-depth friendships, chasing after a professional life that is fulfilling to me and worthwhile to others, etc. – and at the ripe old age of 28, I&#8217;m starting to value sitting back and ponder what my life has held thus far.

For some reason, I think of my college years more than any other period in my life; when I think of that stretch of time, I can truly say that the boy who went in was wildly different from the man who left.<!--more-->

## TL;DR

This is the story of how God introduced Himself to me.

## The Story

> My life before You
>
> I was a flame burning down
>
> I was burning out

During my freshman year, God made Himself known to me. I wasn&#8217;t seeking Him; He wasn&#8217;t anywhere on my mind. One not-so-special evening, a dorm mate invited me to [Flatirons Community Church][1]. Not having anything else going on (and, truthfully, desiring to make friends in this new college world), I went.

I don&#8217;t remember much about that particular evening. I don&#8217;t remember the exact date; I don&#8217;t remember what the pastor talked about; I can&#8217;t even recall what emotions I felt, what conflict I might have endured, or what I left that building with.

In the years since, however, when I think of my friendship with God and &#8220;how it began&#8221;, that time pops up. With hindsight, I can recognize that night as a transformative one; though I had by no means been a wild, out-of-control kid before, the content and character of my life began to take a radically different shape.

> You are the hope that leads me out of the dark

> You let Your love shine down

> You put the light in me

The rest of those 4 years passed in a blur. Between school, friends, social events, difficult responsibilities, and stretching moments, it now exists to me as a broad blanket of experience. As I think back, though, I wonder how many little moments there were in which God gently steered me. Did He care about a young, shy college kid trying to figure out who he was? In those years, did He see a project to finish, or was I something more to Him?

In the years since, one of His intents for my life has become clear: faithful care of those around me. I want to share the same light with them that He has shared with me.

While on his extensive travels, the Apostle Paul wrote to a little church in Philíppi about the importance – the vitality – of finding a way to faithfully care for others:

> Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, **but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.** Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.
>
> *~ Philippians 2:3-7 ESV*

In the last year or so, those words have meant more to me than I can express. &#8220;Count others more significant than yourselves&#8221;&#8230; Though every bone in my body struggles against this, God Himself calls special importance to it.

What are my struggles?

  * When others try to abuse or take advantage of me and my time, I feel justified in lashing out.
  * When I am in the midst of deadlines, I find myself communicating annoyance to others (both in words and body language).
  * When others ask for help, I often find myself (a) annoyed at the &#8220;theft of my time&#8221; and (b) trying to find ways out.
  * In the moments where I do help others, a part of me wants glory for it. I want others to recognize how good/gracious/etc. I am.

On morning like these, God reminds me to stop and remember why these challenges must be struggled through and defeated.

God wants me to show and share His love to my small corner of the world. Just as He has done for me (forgiveness, grace, love, help, aid, friendship, and so much more), so must I bring to others. It&#8217;s what I was built for.

The challenge for this week (which already holds many potentially difficult situations): remember God&#8217;s command to me. Have the same mind as Christ had: shirk what I feel I&#8217;m &#8220;owed&#8221; and care for others out of love, care, concern, and humility. I was made for this.
