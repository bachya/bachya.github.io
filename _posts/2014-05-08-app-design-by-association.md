Marco Arment on the slow,&nbsp;burning demise of App.net&nbsp;(of note was his perspective on building an app with an&nbsp;existing platform):

> Building an app on someone elseâ€™s API, rather than making your own, is a huge risk: it usually only pays off if the service provides a huge existing userbase and hard-to-duplicate functionality.

It&#8217;s true. Of my major projects at the moment, all rely on the continued existence and&nbsp;stability of their respective &#8220;host platforms.&#8221;&nbsp;<a title="Sifttter Redux" href="/tag/sifttter-redux" target="_blank">Sifttter Redux</a>&nbsp;needs&nbsp;<a title="Day One" href="http://dayoneapp.com/" target="_blank">Day One</a> and <a title="IFTTT" href="http://ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> (not to mention <a title="Foursquare" href="http://foursquare.com" target="_blank">Foursquare</a>, <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, etc.) to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;perform at a high level.<sup id="fnref-913-1"><a href="#fn-913-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> ExpandSync relies on both <a title="aText" href="http://www.trankynam.com/atext/" target="_blank">aText</a> and <a title="TextExpander" href="http://smilesoftware.com/apps/" target="_blank">TextExpander Touch</a>, both of which *seem* stable enough. PinPress relies on <a title="Pinboard" href="http://pinboard.in" target="_blank">Pinboard</a>, which, despite an intriguing business model<sup id="fnref-913-2"><a href="#fn-913-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, carries no guarantees.

That said, these&nbsp;projects have one huge&nbsp;difference compared to&nbsp;App.net: they aren&#8217;t trying to make money. If any one of my &#8220;relier&#8221; services shuts down,&nbsp;despite my sadness, I&#8217;ve lost nothing. There was no skin in the game (except for the time I took to develop it, which, truly, is more a gain than a loss).

Perhaps there&#8217;s a more fundamental lesson to be learned here. When I peruse any app store and see completely custom, 100% independent apps, I have no problem paying for them. However, when I see yet another Twitter client that costs money, something in me revolts. I immediately start to think,&nbsp;*&#8220;Is there anything this paid-for app does that the free Twitter app can&#8217;t do and will change my life for the better?&#8221;*

The answer is almost always &#8220;no&#8221;.

The next question, of course, would be,&nbsp;*&#8220;Well, Aaron: if someone wanted to pay you for Sifttter Redux, would you do it?&#8221;* Tricky question, dear reader. Perhaps I wouldn&#8217;t be so altruistic after all.

  Most of the major services that Sifttter Redux works with aren&#8217;t in danger of going away. That said, the service I continually&nbsp;worry about is IFTTT; because&nbsp;services like <a title="Zapier" href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier</a>&nbsp;exist, how much longer can they continue on a free model?&#160;<a href="#fnref-913-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
