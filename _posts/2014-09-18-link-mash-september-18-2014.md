*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

  * **<a title="iOS8review" href="http://www.macstories.net/tag/iOS8review/" target="_blank">iOS8review</a>.** Federico provides the best overall coverage of the iOS 8 release.
  * **<a title="axiak/fuzzyset" href="https://github.com/axiak/fuzzyset" target="_blank">axiak/fuzzyset</a>.** A Python library to do fuzzy text matching. Cool!
  * **<a title="GIF YouTube." href="https://gifyoutube.com/" target="_blank">GIF YouTube.</a>.** If Giphy isn&#8217;t getting the job done, this tool allows you to make your own GIFs from YouTube videos. (via <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/09/17/web-excursions-for-september-17-2014" target="_blank">Brett Terpstra</a>)
  * **<a title="What's New in Drafts 4 (Quick Draft)" href="https://gist.github.com/agiletortoise/044d3f20b3f1a94aa2f7" target="_blank">What&#8217;s New in Drafts 4 (Quick Draft)</a>.** &#8220;Here&#8217;s a first go at a &#8216;What&#8217;s New in Drafts 4&#8217; list for existing users.&#8221; LOOK AT THIS LIST.
  * **<a title="keedreams/keen" href="https://github.com/keedreams/keen" target="_blank">keedreams/keen</a>.** Commander Keen was a huge part of my childhood. Can&#8217;t wait to check this out. (via <a href="https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/511915919363551233" target="_blank">Tim Hopper</a>).
  * **<a title="EricChiang/pup" href="https://github.com/EricChiang/pup" target="_blank">EricChiang/pup</a>.** HTML parsing is hard; <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags" target="_blank">you know that, right?</a> This is a great tool to overcome those difficulties.
  * **<a title="Animated Algorithms" href="http://www.algomation.com/" target="_blank">Animated Algorithms</a>.** Animated representations of algorithms are older than time itself, but still, this is a pretty cool representation.
  * **<a title="Never Forget Your Umbrella Again, With Huginn" href="http://blog.andrewcantino.com/blog/2014/01/12/never-forget-your-umbrella-again-with-huginn/" target="_blank">Never Forget Your Umbrella Again, With Huginn</a>.** Huginn — an open source project that aims to be an open, private IFTTT/Zapier/Yahoo! Pipes/etc. — is one of those projects that I&#8217;ve wanted to implement, yet struggled to. This article (and its two follow up articles, [here][2] and [here][3]) might just get me over the hump.
  * **<a title="Induction - A Polyglot Database Client For Mac OS X" href="http://inductionapp.com/" target="_blank">Induction &#8211; A Polyglot Database Client For Mac OS X</a>.** An interesting data visualization tool for a variety of data sources.

  * **<a title="The Ultimate Smart iTunes Playlist" href="http://equivocality.com/2011/01/31/the-ultimate-smart-itunes-playlist/" target="_blank">The Ultimate Smart iTunes Playlist</a>.** I&#8217;m more of a Spotify man these days, but back in the day, my &#8220;Smart Radio&#8221; iTunes playlist — which contained a mix of new stuff, rare stuff, and favorites (all weighted correctly), while simultaneously leaving out the stuff that I didn&#8217;t care for — was the best thing on earth. This article was where it all started.
  * **<a title="Automatically Log Work Hours with IFTTT" href="http://n8henrie.com/2014/09/automatically-log-work-hours-with-ifttt/" target="_blank">Automatically Log Work Hours with IFTTT</a>.** Nathan Henrie is an automation king in my book. Here&#8217;s a great workflow of his: using IFTTT location triggers to automatically track his work day in a Google Spreadsheet.
  * **<a title="vinta/awesome-python" href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python" target="_blank">vinta/awesome-python</a>.** I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m late to the ball with this one, but oh my, what an amazing list of Python libraries. Can&#8217;t wait to test some ideas out in Pythonista. <img src="http://www.bachyaproductions.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * **<a title="The iOS @@ shortcut is so useful, you'll never use your iPhone the same way again" href="http://www.cultofmac.com/294484/ios-shortcut-useful-youll-never-use-iphone-way/" target="_blank">The iOS @@ shortcut is so useful, you&#8217;ll never use your iPhone the same way again</a>.** I already have email address text expansion snippets, but these are too appetizing not to try.
  * **<a title="Refining The Way We Structure Our CSS At Trello" href="http://blog.trello.com/refining-the-way-we-structure-our-css-at-trello/" target="_blank">Refining The Way We Structure Our CSS At Trello</a>.** If you&#8217;ve ever wondered about the newest techniques in modern CSS, this is a great article explaining how Trello does it.
  * **<a title="PopKey | Animated GIF keyboard." href="http://popkey.co/" target="_blank">PopKey | Animated GIF keyboard.</a>.** OH EM GEE. When it comes out in the States, I bet I spend the majority of my time in this keyboard.
  * **<a title="worldveil/dejavu" href="https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu" target="_blank">worldveil/dejavu</a>.** Is it twisted of me that I want to somehow incorporate this sweet Python audio recognition library into Pythonista?
  * **<a title="Convert various text file formats in the OS X Terminal with textutil" href="http://www.macissues.com/2014/08/18/convert-various-text-file-formats-in-the-os-x-terminal-with-textutil/" target="_blank">Convert various text file formats in the OS X Terminal with textutil</a>.** I&#8217;m constantly surprised at the little utilities that OS X contains by default. This is another one.
  * **<a title="The Perfect Web Development Environment for Your New Mac" href="http://mallinson.ca/osx-web-development/" target="_blank">The Perfect Web Development Environment for Your New Mac</a>.** In my previous life as a web developer, I had a setup similar to this – great set of ideas to make a development environment work much more cleanly.
