*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

  * <a href="https://draftin.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Draft</strong></a>. I&#8217;ve tried no shortage of writing apps. This one brings a bunch of neat features to the table: collaborative editing, &#8220;tracked changes&#8221; mode, export to Evernote, Dropbox, etc. Not sure it&#8217;s a permanent addition to my toolkit, but we&#8217;ll give it a shot.
  * **<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabcloud/npecfdijgoblfcgagoijgmgejmcpnhof/related?hl=en" target="_blank">TabCloud for Chrome</a>**. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve gone as long as I have without this extension. It&#8217;s premise is simple: if you&#8217;ve got too many tabs open in Chrome, use this extension to save them into easy-to-access-later groups.
  * <a href="https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader" target="_blank"><strong>Dropbox-Uploader</strong></a>. I&#8217;ve experimented with a Raspberry Pi lately and want to get Dropbox files to it. This great set of Bash scripts does the trick.
  * <a href="http://gizmodo.com/how-i-lost-my-50-000-twitter-username-1511578384" target="_blank"><strong>How I Lost My $50,000 Twitter Username</strong></a>. Another fascinating read on Twitter-based identity hacking.
  * <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2014/01/how-the-us-almost-killed-the-internet" target="_blank"><strong>How the U.S. Almost Killed The Internet</strong></a>. I waffle between thinking that the NSA is evil and that its actions are necessary. This great piece from Wired gets into the weeds and lays out a case for both.
  * <a href="http://www.techworld.com.au/article/536950/rise_rise_javascript" target="_blank"><strong>The Rise and Rise of Javascript</strong></a>. In my heavy-duty web development days, I remember thinking, &#8220;How has no one come up with an alternative to Javascript?&#8221; This article makes a great point: not only might that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> happen, it might actually be a good thing.
  * <a href="http://www.faith-theology.com/2014/01/tweeting-psalms-book-i.html" target="_blank"><strong>Tweeting the Psalms: Book I</strong></a>. The Psalms represent some of the most poetic, most human passages in the Bible. I ran across this the other day: each Psalm described in under 140 characters.
