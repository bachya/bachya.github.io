*The weekly Link Mash is a curated selection of tools, stories, and other links that I found during my travels on the web. All of my links can be found on&nbsp;<a title="Bachya's Pinboard: Link Mash" href="https://pinboard.in/u:bachya/t:link-mash/" target="_blank">my Pinboard</a>; you can also find the Link Mash archives <a href="/tag/link-mash/" target="_blank">here</a>.*

  * **<a title="LICEcap" href="http://www.cockos.com/licecap/" target="_blank">LICEcap</a>.** I&#8217;m certainly not the first to the game here, but when it comes to recording animated GIFs of my screen activity, I&#8217;ve yet to find a better app than LICEcap.
  * **<a title="Generating URL Scheme for YouVersion&apos;s Bible App using&nbsp;Pythonista" href="http://www.geekswithjuniors.com/note/generating-url-scheme-for-youversions-bible-app-using-python.html" target="_blank">Generating URL Scheme for YouVersion&apos;s Bible App using&nbsp;Pythonista</a>.** A great post on an advanced workflow. I have a ton of respect for Eric (and not just for his technical prowess).
  * **<a title="OmniFocus Contexts, Folders, Perspectives, and Tasks in Launch Center Pro" href="http://hackmake.org/2012/07/omnifocus-contexts-folders-perspective-and-tasks-in-launch-center-pro" target="_blank">OmniFocus Contexts, Folders, Perspectives, and Tasks in Launch Center Pro</a>.** Ever been frustrated with getting OmniFocus for iOS to display perspectives via its URL scheme? Look no further.
  * **<a title="deaghean/omnifocus-perspective-icons" href="https://github.com/deaghean/omnifocus-perspective-icons" target="_blank">deaghean/omnifocus-perspective-icons</a>.** A great set of icons for custom OmniFocus perspectives; they also double as great icons for Launch Center Pri
  * **<a title="Enabling italic fonts in iTerm2, tmux, and vim" href="https://alexpearce.me/2014/05/italics-in-iterm2-vim-tmux/" target="_blank">Enabling italic fonts in iTerm2, tmux, and vim</a>.** A rather simple thing that you never think about; then, it arrives, and you wondered how you lived without it.
